2,"I just applied switched to Octopus , but can I check in advanced if my building is qualified to install Smart Meter please? Thank you"
3,What do I need to do to get smart metres...
4,Could of phoned me 
5,I'm sure I was the millionth customer but I missed my phone call off you guys. Happy to take the prize still 😬
6,What about loyal customers? All we get is an increased bill!!!!
7,"Is there any news on coming to northern ireland, I'd love to switch"
8,Fantastic news 📰 
9,Well done Octopus 🐙. Another happy customer!!
10,Hi I’d like to know when I will get my balance back to my account as have left you now and had quite a bit of money in my account. Thanks 
11,Best decision to join these. So can wait for the final switch day for gas then be happily set. The staff are lovely and everything gets sorted. Wish I could know how to get one of the teddy octopus though as there cute
12,Brilliant. I am so pleased that I changed to Octopus Energy. I will never change! I wish I had found you sooner. 💖💖
13,Well done xxx
14,Octopus is very very active. They installed smart meter at my home in 20 days. 
15,Amazing 🥰
16,Nice one Octopus Energy & lucky 🍀 Laura. Nice to hear it went to a client that it will make a difference too. 
17,Great company with a social conscience.  An acquaintance told me last week that when his mother died in November Octopus waived the debit on her account
18,"Well done, awesome company "
19,Lisa 
20,Switch tomorrow and can’t wait! from Eon Next (previously Npower) had been a customer over 10 years and were out sold to eon who set up a joke of a new company with no decent tarrifs. Lost all our historical data on the npower app when they shut it down with no notice. 
21,We cannot wait to switch to octopus - we are with Scottish power and they harass customers. Price capped for two years and yet within two months increased the direct debit TWICE from £93 to £161!! They don't even know the meaning of priority neither so we cannot wait to come over to octopus energy.
22,"Brilliant story, well done Octopus Energy!

I put my name down on the waiting list for smart meters quite some time ago but still haven't been contacted. Would you be able to look into this please? "
23,My next one 
24,"All very nice. Lucky lady. But maybe if you put as much into looking after your current customers & rectifying the issues they have, as you did this two millionth one you’d have every single one of your customers happy too 🙁🤷🏼‍♀️"
25,Maureen Jenkins
26,Saw it on The Tonight Programme last night 
27,"Clever stuff , just need an electric car for £5k lol"
28,"Great, how can those already got EV take advantage of this? I’m already an OctopusEnergyCustomer. "
29,Andrew Coventry  ?
30,Nathan Stevenson and Jacqueline Stevenson
31,"I’m about to change energy suppliers and I’m interested in green energy.
The problem is that I don’t understand how this works. I take it that I will be contributing to producing green energy, but will receive whatever comes down the line. Please can you explain in laymen’s terms 😊"
32,Octopus Energy  Are you checking emails sent to the hello@octopus as my mom sent one begining of the week and we really need it answered ASAP
33,Why don’t you answer any emails - the most appalling customer service EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!
34,"I emailed the other day but haven't had anything back.
I've been with you for 13 months, and I want to go from a prepayment meter to a credit meter but want to know if this is possible please."
35,You have sent me a bill for the 13th to 19th February for electricity as a smart meter reading I do t have one and I have my readings in the 13th which you have already billed me for 
36,Any chance of this coming to Scotland?
37,Is anyone available to talk. I have an emergency 
38,"I have had ongoing issues with octopus and their customer services is the worst I have ever experienced.  They are polite, but utterly useless and they do not reply to emails unless you leave them very bad public reviews. They "
39,Hi Octopus. I sent a few emails last week but not heard back yet. Please could you give your support guys a nudge in my direction please 😊 🐙 
40,Very very bad customer Service they block your e mail specialy miss Claudine very rude person!!!!! They make me for one month flat one bed 1039£ just for electricity and no one wanna talk with you to help whats is Wrong!!!!!!
41,Why can’t octopus energy answer my questions on my account - I have just fixed another year with you and suddenly I’m hit with my account being in arrears when it’s always been in credit - so much for customer loyalty as it appears all it’s doing for me is costing me more money and stress 
42,"So i just got off the phone to Octupus Energy and it seems if you have a smart meter already installed and being supplied by another energy company you can NOT switch to octopus energy . Guys please make this more clear to everyone , this could have saved me alot of time waiting to speak to you guys . Its a real shame was looking forward to switching  to you guys had heard good things about you .😢"
43,"Hey Octopus Energy, 

I've tried calling you guys, but you won't speak to me on the phone unless I have an account number or are looking to sign up with you guys.

I've emailed you 3 times about the matter I want to speak to you about, and have had no response."
44,I switched to you in November but have just had a bill from old supplier even though I’m paying you also I called Friday someone was meant to call me back have emailed numerous times and nothing not a great impression 
45,"Hi, used to pay my bills from previous company for both gas and electricity £95.00 maximum for both. Since I seen your advertisement, your traffic was very cheaper than my previous company so joined with you in December 2020. While I am joining in the very beginning your colleague said there is a problem  with my smart meter and they will fixed in the first week. Now my bill gone up to £140 for both gas and electricity for  month of January bill. I brought this concerns to your customer service department and they seems to change the story that if you want to send the engineer to fix the problem I need to pay £80. I am totally disappointed with the response ."
46,"Hi can you send me the email address to contact you? I did send one but didn’t get a reply, I am a customer thanks "
47,Can’t wait until my smart is installed so I can benefit from the Octopus Go tariff for my EV charging.  Hopefully won’t be too long now a clearer COVID roadmap has been announced 🙏 🤞 
48,I’ve emailed multiple times and no reply can you get back to me ASAP thanks 
49,"Hi Octopus. I've been trying to reach you by email over the past couple of month and had no response. Smart meter has been out of action for over 6 months now on two separate occasions. I am pleading with you to get this sorted, at my wits end. Can you please look at my emails and get back to me?!"
50,Have just joined you from Thursday.
51,"Why won't it let me submit a gas reading online? It says not installed, but I've been able to submit them up until October 2020. Has no option online to fix this issue"
52,Going. Into our third year with OctopusEnergy very happy 
53,Trying to switch to Octopus but no reply to my emails so far...
54,"Our meter is set up on the wrong serial number. The meter on the website is not mine. I have been trying to get this sorted out for days. When i email it takes a week to reply no matter what it says about your median waiting times. twice i have been told its being sorted and twice nothing has happened.  I still can't see the gas meter online and as of a couple of days ago the In Home Display now wont display gas or electric and keeps rebooting, last week i could at least see Gas on it but now nothing. The usage on the website for electric used to be viewable a day later but now its not updated since sunday so i'm not even sure its still sending you readings. All in all this smart meter is the opposite of smart and i am starting to regret getting it at all! "
55,Emailed a week ago about my smart meter. Not worked since been installed. Can someone respond to my email please
56,I wish I hadn't joined as don't reply to emails
57,"I’m with eon next after previously been with n power .
If I switch to yourself do I have to have smart meters installed ? 
I do not want them "
58,I am impressed by Octopus energy claim to br Green whilst supplying the same ratio electricity fossil/renewable as everyone else. That means my 4 lite diesel is green because I have a big garden with 60 trees! I feel like David Attenborough! 😍
59,Absolutely no point!  Joined last year and had my meter swapped out last Sep and Octopus Energy still haven't got it working despite numerous phone calls and emails.  Just keep getting fobbed off all the while still racking up costs under the old scheme.  
60,Not impressed with octopus energy they have taken £300+ from my bank this week. Plus my electricity they are charging me £153.42 a month. I left my old supp2due to paying that amount. I don't even use that amount in a month. I have sent them emails tried to phone and nothing.
61,Do you guys have an official app ?
62,"I like Octopus Energy but find their customer service shocking.  I sent a request, two-three weeks ago, to have some money returned to my account.  After waiting a week and a half I sent up a follow-up email...nothing.  Last week I sent another email and...nothing"
63,Still waiting for my indoor display unit to register the gas usage. I have been told it being investigated but I can’t believe it takes this long. The display was installed on the 8th January.
64,"You encourage customers to email people rather than call, have median reply times around 1-3 hours yet the reality is that you wait 5-7 days for an email reply, that asks for more info 🤯 "
65,"I wanted to switch from my current provider and I emailed 3 weeks ago to the quote email on your website and followed up a week later, I have also emailed facebook@octopus.energy a week ago and have still had no response to my quote. Guess I’ll try some else as you seem to be no better than my current provider!"
66,"Has anyone picked up my email yet, i was speaking with some one on messenger but we can use the messenger function now if not could someone email me then i can get back to you that way, as seems my emails aren’t being picked up"
67,"Rubbish customer service, really wish I hadn't switched to these now! After sending initial reads, and then when asked sending photos of the readings, this lot tried to say the initial read would be 250kwh higher than it was. Still no response to my emails. Avoid this lot at all costs"
68,"The house we moved in to had a smart meter when we moved in. But was with another supplier and they wanted me to pay an extra 50 a month so I did a comparison switch at a fixed rate with Octopus, the day of the switch my smart meter display stopped working 🤷🏻‍♀️ and they said I needed a new meter fitting. And a month after being with them, my ""Fixed rate"" went up by £25 quid...that was last month 🤦🏻‍♀️ 

I've now waited in twice for you guys to fit a new meter. Complete no show, didn't contact me to say you weren't coming!

Seriously guys?! What is going on? My first time with Octopus and I'm really not impressed!!"
69,Do you change economy 7 meters to Smart meters
70,Could you tell me how automatic readings are taken please and why they would start being taken randomly after 2 years of being with Octopus and having to submit meter readings instead? Thanks
71,"We were pleased with Octopus initially but then at some stage our monthly DD wasn't covering our usage, and no one informed us. So month by month you're further into debit, and no one told us. Until....... you're way way into debit and now Octopus have kindly informed us our monthly payments will DOUBLE until we are within sight of being in credit and then still be £60 to £80 more a month. We'll be going elsewhere once the bill is sorted. Thanks Octopus."
72,Can someone from OctopusEnergy message me please. 
73,Hi Octopus. I need my meter moving from inside my house to outside. Is it you who’d do that or Cadent? Cheers 
74,Rude company! You Cold called me. Before i could even explain I was doing home schooling and if he could call back later as I WAS interested he grunted down the phone at me and hung up. I’ll pass. 
75,"And because you shouldn't talk the talk if you can't hawk the hawk –

Here's Jack, the offending bird, at the scene of the crime. "
76,Sounds like a bit of a 'Hawkward' situation! 🙄😂

90,No point hawking on about it!
91,I've emailed you 3 times Octopus Energy  and still no reply. You will not be getting paid if you do not reply to my email 
92,Why am I not surprised dispite sending a email to the facebook team.  I still have not received an answer to my problem. So it seems you are no more use facebook team than the normal emails or phone calls.  All ofyou say you will get back to me (you dont) your sorry (your not) you know how i must feel (you dont) I think you have a sheet of paper to read from.
93,I'd love an ihd but been waiting for a smart meter for over two years. Any time soon guys?
94,Hi Octopus Energy I have just joined with you for my gas and electric. How do I go about gaining an IHD?
95,IHD doesn't pick up electric supply? Any suggestions Octopus?
96,"Hi Oct,
My fixed octopus price is 1060. 26, calcating all my  bills from the day i signed up, i being charged 1,088.88.

Why? I need explanation  and i asked for new quotation as my fix term coming to an end but i was given high quotation."
97,"I need to call you as I'm confused over my bill. The number on your letter and on here say they are invalid. Can you advise of a CORRECT number. I don't want to email, I need to sort on the phone."
98,Is there anyone at OCTOPUS I can speak to privately 😡
99,"Thank you so much ❤ absolute fantastic customer service today, power cut and within 15 minutes of sending an email you arranged an engineer to try and sort things."
100,Please can you reply to my email. Thank you!

102,"Your wheel of fortune is a scam, you need to publish who wins, I don't know of a single winner."
103,I am a smart meter customer of yours so can I have a link for the wheel thing...x
104,I have emailed you and still waiting for a response.  I have since also recieved a debt letter for the previous occupant.  Please could someone get back to me asap to sort this out.
105,Can someone please tell me how to make an official complaint regarding the service I've received?
106,I'm still trying to get a smart meter installation!!!  What is going on with Octopus and or AES
107,I've returned to Octopus after moving to another supplier. Glad to be back to a hassle free supplier and wish I never left!
108,Still waiting for my money.. it’s nearly been a year... wouldn’t trust this bunch at all... total con as far as I’m concerned 
109,Is there a charge for leaving ???
110,I have emailed to request a quote but not had a response yet.
111,Scam of a company stick your bill up every month never let you know break terms and conditions of contract what a joke !
112,won't respond to my emails; tel number does not work - how on earth can a customer get hold of someone????
113,"IM PUZZLED: for the last 13months, which includes TWO winters, our heating bills have averaged £58 per calendar month....we are looking at switching...OCTOPUS team have quoted their LOWEST price - for us - as £82 per calendar month IF we pay by DD...that appears to be around £200 that we are likely to end up in credit!!!!! DOES THIS SEEM FAIR?"
114,Hey I just sent an email could you have a look please? I sent it to the Facebook email 
115,Can someone from octopus please message me so I can message back thanks
116,This company was taking money out my bank willingly every month for gas and wasn't even supplying me it was another company who have now got debt collecting agrncie of me I think ofgem deserve a call and told about the splendid job they do there
117,OCTOPUS ENERGY Is SIMPLY THE BEST.

122,Gerrup!!! Excellent!! When do the winner get announced from the latest quiz? 
123,Octopus Energy  have you announced / emailed all the winners of last week's pub quiz yet? Thanks.
124,👏🏽👏🏽🐙🐙🐙
125,Let me guess!! ScottishPower are the worst Again.😂😂
126,I sent e-mail yesterday about apply and haven't answer yet. When I can expect answer?
127,"I’ve requested 2 call backs, called numerous times, emailed and tried via FB. No response, bad show. 3 business accounts lost"
128,We love octopus. Our bill went up initially but has since stayed the same..we've always managed to speak to someone mon-fri 
129,"Hey, I sent a couple of emails yesterday, when  can I expect a reply? Thanks"
130,Excellent news!
131,"I moved to Octopus go one month ago, and the In Home Display still showing old tariff for electricity and no tariff for gas..."
132,Never critical and been with you since you formed BUT smart meter installed December and still it’s not registered for use! Dreadful service and no reply to my email Sunday 
133,Yet I still don't get my refund !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
134,Please could I have a smart meter at 84 I find it difficult to take meter readings.
135,Just wondering when we will be having a smart meter fitted as we applied for this in July when we moved house and not heard anything 
136,I have to say I switched from ScottishPower to OctopusEnergy over a year ago and had problems with ScottishPower smart meter had quite a few telephone calls to OctopusEnergy and the calls I have had mostly with the lady’s have been second to none very helpful keep it up 
137,It was a great post #winningest 😀
138,I’ve sent 2 emails about a ridiculously high gas usage in an empty property.  No reply yet and I’ve just moved to Octopus but wondering if I’ve done the right thing 
139,My husband has been trying to get hold of you. You initially replied but our enquiry still isn't sorted. It is urgent we get it resolved as we are moving house. If you could respond it would be appreciated. Thank you.
140,I've sent messages to octopus energy( prepayment@octopus.enrgy) about switching energy till now I receive no response. I don't what's happening 
141,Clearly the bar isn’t set very high if you’re winning awards!
142,What are the unit prices for octopus please
143,Im still waiting for a response!!! Been over a month now for my issue!!! Starting to get annoyed!!!!!
144,"I'd also quite like to get a response to my emails questioning why my monthly direct debit is vastly increasing, seemingly based on a grossly inflated estimate of my gas use. Despite responding on the same day and chasing you up for a response every day this week, it's unacceptable to ignore queries for a company that prides itself on customer service. Hopefully this will be rectified before a massive monthly payment is taken out on the 18th of February"
145,Finally got my key and it seems its working. Does the night rate start at midnight or earlier? Thanks
146,I have just had a smart meter fitted yesterday but when I have just tried to switch to you it's saying I still have pre payment meter
147,Trevor Austin
148,"Well said Octopus 🐙 I ,for one will not be changing!!!!!¡!"
149,"You put my prices up before this was announced, as a low user."
150,Neither will I.
151,Telephone number
152,I am with Octopus and I have nothing but good things to say  about them
153,"Reassuring to hear, been a customer for a few years and been happy with Octopus. "
154,That’s why we moved. Now paying 11.49ppt instead of 16.26. And what’s unfair is that we left Octopus a month ago and you still owe us money! AVOID!!!
155,Have been with you for 3 yrs nearly I won’t be changing to another company lovely staff so helpful  too 🐙 x 
156,I won’t be changing!!! Love Octopus!!
157,Found Octopus really good since I switched a few years back...
158,I have contacted octopus on the 23/01/21 and 27/01/21 and all I get is a generic response saying they will get back to me and nobody has... our monthly energy bill has gone from £96 a month to £138 a month even though we have less people living at the address and less utilities being used...
159,Don't reply to emails
160,Not had any problems with Octopus..much better than being with others that I have been with.
161,I'm with octopus and I have nothing but praise and good reviews for them.
162,Julie Ban 😁
163,And that's another reason why our household is with you.
164,Are we still paying 5% tax of our gas/electric bill to the EU?
165,We are with OctopusEnergy all the way 
166,"My experience is that Octopus have been really great, they’re responsive and always very proactive."
167,And this is why I've been happy with octopus 🐙 for the past 3 years.
168,"I am with Octopus as well i also don't have a bad word against them, I'm always telling friends to switch over to them. I am extremely happy"

174,Thanks Octopus. First-time joining in. Been looking forward to this all day as I'm isolating! Got a couple wrong along the way but we got there in the end. Fingers crossed everyone x
175,Thank you we enjoyed it was a bit of fun and something different to do

Thanks very much, enjoyable."

192,"I rang to find out about moving to you, was told we are open 9-5.....it was 4pm 🤔"
193,Awesome quiz and so Octopus energy on the scrambled quiz 😝
194,Like many others I answered within seconds and haven’t heard anything - thought it was the first 500 plus random spot prizes as well.   Hard to believe wasn’t in the first 500 to respond 😮

207,Have sent email to you well 2 or 3 emails havent heard back yet .concerning my account.
208,Does the little octopus come with it too..very cute 😍
209,"Had a new meter fitted on 31 dec . It's apparently not connected at your end

Is there a way I can escalate within octopus? 

I really don’t want to leave octopus but I’m not getting any confirmation of what’s happening and when..... just feels like this could go on for ages??

Pls can you advise....

Thx

248,competetive rates! that's why i decided to stick with them for another year. i hope this time i finally get to win something at their wheel of fortune🤞
249,"Brilliant news, congratulations Octopus Energy! Truly the best company and so proud to be a customer. I was just thinking earlier today would it be a 4th year and ... here we are"
250,Fantastic news and well deserved!! 😊👍
251,I need help swapping over tried once but utilitia stopped I’ve sorted the problem with them now but don’t know how to try again 
252,Best ever energy company.  Always someone on the end of the phone. First class service 👌
253,Well done octopusy I’ve been with you for 3 yrs now and your a 5 ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ in my book
254,Good service 👍. Just wish you could get on with fitting our smart meter - costing a lot more till we can get on to a time based tariff...
255,Brilliant.  I've been a customer for 5 years and love this company.  They deserve every accolade they are given.  They've really shaken up a complacent energy market ❤️❤️
256,Have octopus put the prices up on 12 month fixed. As i seem to be spend a lot more then i did befoe christmas
257,"Hi, we are currently using a pay as you go  SMETS2 meter, how easy would it be to switch over to you as providers?"
258,"Great company, great rates and great customer service. Best move i ever made."
259,Adam Clark One for your morning meeting mate 😉😂
260,"Agreed, great company generally, however I'm still awaiting a reply to 2 emails sent in the past week.

Are your turnaround times being affected at the moment?"
261,Best ever would reccomend  well done x
262,"Beware if you want to switch to Octopus Go!! 
Switched thinking I would get a smart meter installed for the ‘Go’ tariff (as advertised), but have so far been fobbed off meaning I’m not getting the night rate to charge the car! A pointless switch!"
263,If I join on your tracker scheme how long will it take to install a smets2 meter as I assume tracker requires this? My post code is Rh3  
264,Hopefully you will be able to invest in your website and at least be able to add in usage / consumption  graphs.
265,Well done great company best move i made
266,I dont know how. You cant even reply to emails.
267,Is the Octopus Go tariff ending? Rather confusing e mail received this morning.
268,Brilliant service. Best change i made
269,"Good morning Octopus. I just received a text  purporting to be from you asking for a meter reading, I thought that with a Smart meter this was no longer needed ?? Could this be a scam ??"
270,"Just made the switch, 5th supplier in 6 months, hope I have finally made the right decision."
271,Hi octopus. My smart meter has stopped working if was installed by EDF. I has looked on site checked it is near to meters bit still not working. Can you get readings directly from meters?

297,"The idea of electric cars in essence is good, but there are several things against them I think. The battery manufacturing process and the chemicals used, the eventual disposal of the battery, not enough charging locations, but the big one for me is that they are way, way, way to expensive. I'd love one but not at £20k - £30k ☹️"
298,"Battery is totally recyclable. Can be turned into a battery once again. Nothings perfect but given the process for ice which is not recyclable and is not getting power from renewables, the choice is obvious. Electric cars are only more expensive while it ramps up and legacy manufacturers hold onto their ice assets as long as they can. The ones that ramp up now will reap the benefits later on. "

306,Can I ask why I am never able to get the spin game to work when I submit my readings. I have been with you a few months and am generally pleased but this wheel thing never appears when I go to it. I know I have little chance of winning anything but it's annoying not to even get a chance!
307,Looks like you guys had fun producing the video and preparing the draw!

339,Can someone message me please
340,my smart meters are made by secure so will they stay smart so i can top up online?
341,I need to speak to someone online.
342,"Mine is under my tree, it came today 🐙"
343,Mine is called Octopussy  and after having my Smart meters fitted she now has twins  but I can't seem to post the picture
344,
345,I've tried to call but your lines are down so I have emailed you and its urgent. Had new meter fitted Wednesday and now my storage heaters and electric radiators are not working. Had an electrician out today and he said I need to contact you. I have 4 children in a cold house so it's rather urgent. Thank you.
346,"I have emailed you twice about getting my smart meter installed and had no response, been with you 3 months now and getting fed up waiting think I’ll change suppliers"
347,Any chance Octopus could increase the times for phone lines?
348,Gemma Swiers  do you want an octopus? Xxx. 
349,No point phoning customer services they just fob you off and never get back to you
350,Wait wait - I can get a giant plush octopus for just being a member! 
351,I have sent an email no answer. I want to switch my plan. Thanks
352,"You don't reply to emails either. Never quite known customer service like it. 

Switched to be with you and will be switching away from you in the New Year. 

6months later and the switch to you guys is still ongoing with no resolution and multiple emails ignored."
353,And why aren't you replying to email and messages I've sent you guy's 2 now
354,Hi. Yet again i have been put on 1 rate and my heating wint work. Is this will be goin on every week?
355,I joined up recently  really happy. Easy to do and I've already recieved my referral credit to my account.
356,"Are you likely to get a prepayment system the same as utilita ?, Theirs is a really convenient way of paying especially when you're working and not easy to get to shops."

369,Can I have the engine please?
370,Heu you should reply to your emails and the phone calls i am trying to reach you since 3 days it is urgent 
371,"I have a 1967 beetle,how much is the conversion "
372,that's great but the 6/7 month plus wait for a smart meter to power it is a bit ridiculous!!!
373,I have sent a message please can someone have a look and come back to me!
374,"Urrghh, only been with you several weeks and you are already trying to up my direct debit.
Agile tariff only started today and all of a sudden you estimate that I am going to use much more.

378,Does anyone else get irritated when the octopus energy advert comes on?  🤔
379,Hi if my balance is -£168 does that mean I owe you that amount or you owe me that amount it’s not very clear on my statement
380,Hi. We need help. Things are now completely out of control. Our account should have been closed and refunded over a month ago. No one we have spoken to seems to be able to fix the problem and refund us what is owed.

408,Keep up the good work
409,Just swapped over  And saving a fortune
410,Well pleased with go apart from not being able to do export with the go tariff I think it is petty
411,"I’ve been a customer for some years and requested a smart meter since I joined. I emailed the other month and got a very short reply saying you aren’t fitting meters in my area (north Kent).  Do you have any ideas when you will be in that area, I’ve been requesting for around 3 years now."
412,Grt company keep up the gd work
413,"Love your Facebook updates and your amazing app, so easy to read 🐙🐙🐙👍👍"
414,"Had my Smart meter fitted today. Excellent engineer who worked around my wife & I doing crazy NHS works from home. Really a superb company - this is what gets loyal customers. The same cannot be said about BG who I think I’m about to go into a legal battle with. Today the Octopus Engineer confirmed BG are in the wrong (as I already knew), in that situation and I can get a report from OctopusEnergy to back up my claim, I couldn’t be more grateful. "
415,"We inherited BG old style smart meters in this house, after I changed to Octopus some 3+ years ago the indoor monitor worked OK to read the meters. It stopped working about a year ago, still turns on and gives the meter numbers etc., but not the current reading. Can Octopus do anything to help, either with a new monitor paired to my existing meters or with new smart meters? "
416,Terrible customer service!
417,...I've just had a very worrying e-mail saying that you're going to have to double my direct debit due to my 'usage' - but I'm out at work all day so there should be hardly ANY usage at all ....and this is the same weird arrangement that BULB tried ...who have an awful reputation for overcharging customers. I changed from them to YOU recently - and now you seem to be getting false calculations from my submitted meter readings too !
418,Terrible!!!! Telephone staff are very sarcastic and patronising. They forget to charge you then it becomes the customers problem!!!! Totally disorganised!!!
419,Best energy supplier we have ever had. Customer Service second to none
420,Hello. I’m thinking about switching to Octopus from British Gas and your estimates look very attractive. Before going for it can you tell me whether my British Gas fitted Smart meters will be a problem in switching please?
421,Got an ETA yet for fitting smart meters in Plymouth?
422,Has anyone got a referral code as I am planning on switching to octopus. Thanks

426,"Hi, despite my constant requests on here, the website and by adding myself to the ""priority queue"" I've still not received an installation date or even an acknowledgement of my request.
I enclose an email I sent you on 27th July also.

Not being funny but it's not as though I haven't tried and I switched in good faith to Octopus energy on the promise I could take advantage of your EV rates and all I've had at the moment is a broken promise.

So I'm giving this one last try. 
PLEASE ACCEPT THIS AS A 7 DAY NOTICE THAT UNLESS YOU CAN SORT THIS MATTER BY GETTING A SATISFACTORY INSTALLATION DATE TO ME IN THIS TIME I SHALL CANCEL MY DD WITH YOU, TRANSFER TO ANOTHER SUPPLIER AND CONTACT THE ENERGY WATCHDOG TO VOICE MY CONCERNS THAT YOU ARE PROMISING CUSTOMERS THE PROMISE OF A CONTRACT THAT YOU CANNOT DELIVER.

587,Great news from a great company! The best I’ve ever used in my lifetime 😊
588,Maybe some of those 1000 jobs will help to get smart meters installed. I moved my energy account in April and I’m still waiting for my meter to be installed. It was supposed to happen today and got cancelled. You would have thought that someone would have notified me but I had to call up to find out what was going on. Was offered another appointment in 3 weeks time which will probably be cancelled again. Not very impressed at all and will be looking to move my account as soon as I am able.
589,Great company ~ Octopus ~ glad to hear your news on job front.
590,My mam currently left u and is still waiting for her money back from ur selfs after she has emailed u to request this 
591,"And then you allowed yourself to be used by the Tories to greenwash their image. Do that again, you'll lose my custom. They are responsible for many more job losses than you will ever create, and have killed many more still with their inept handling of the pandemic."

600,I had my smart meter installation about a month ago yesterday I received the link to change to Agile but it then says your meter is the wrong type your agent was not helpful at all yesterday and has stopped replying to my emails can you please help ? 
601,I wouldn’t even go with this company! At first it was great now they keep upping the price over and over they installed a meter that wasn’t taking readings then charged me through the roof for it they’ve upped the charges 2 weeks before my direct debit is due without my consent during this pandemic when I may not even be able to afford it! Charging me £92 alone for electric when there’s only 3 rooms in my entire tiny house I checked my usage which is 47-50 a month I’ve emailed and messaged on Facebook and they just ignore you. Still waiting for a reply since Saturday or Sunday. It’s now Wednesday.
602,Octopus energy is a scam. I am being charged 16p per KWH for my electricity while I wait for smart meters to be fitted so I can go on the Go/Agile tariff for my Electric Vehicle. They can’t give me any indication of when I can expect the meters to be fitted. Very disappointing. Time to switch?
603,"Oh dear.....am l the only happy customer?

622,"Go for it Octopus, it was a great choice of mine to switch to you"
623,Maybe you need to focus on sorting out your customer service here in the UK before expanding🤦‍♀️
624,I would be more impressed if you worked with the UK government to ensure that all your customers could have functioning smart meters instead of offering a smart tariff for electric car users and then doing nothing to install smart meters for tens of thousands of rural customers for over 15 months. And blaming it on the lack of a Wide Area Network doesn't wash; it's your job to sort that out. Sort out your UK operation. 
625,Why don’t you provide energy in Northern Ireland?
626,"I agree with Rebecca,
Why don’t you ( Octopus) answer emails which were sent to you 3 days ago?"
627,"Initially pleased with my switch, but of late your customer ""service"" has gone to hell in a handcart. You're STILL trying to take direct debit payments from my account when I'm on a KEY METER, which I asked you to change in JUNE, and you STILL can't give me any idea of when (more like IF!) I'll get a regular meter. AND, I'm STILL waiting on a refund on the credit I've built up! NOT A HAPPY BUNNY!

650,"Dont bother using email. I just got a reply from Octopus from an email sent 5 days ago.  Best bet is to use messenger. Still waiting to switch to Agile after a SMETS2 meter was installed 2 weeks ago.  Didnt connect whilst the engineer was here, but is now.  I have not even been told if they can now see it.  If the lack of communication continues I will be forced to switch again!"

I’ve looked at my account and you have put it up by an extra £30.00 a month.

656,We signed up with a sales representative who knocked on our door in July. Signed us up to a great deal. Cheaper tariff than we were paying with EDF. Sadly our first bill comes through and we have to increase our monthly payments. Surely this is wrong????! Same has happened to 3 neighbours who signed up with the same person. He got his commission and we are left paying more each month?!?!?!

686,Yes Gideon Johnston that is true with most or every energy supplier as they have standard charge for each meter used

I have paid £107 religiously every month by direct debit and recieved an email yesterday that they'd be collecting my monthly direct debit of £148. When did we ever agree to a £40 increase???!!!!!! I will be changing supplier. I've seen people complain about you guys and I've just kept my mouth shut not understanding what they're on about because you always seemed fair to me, BUT YOU'RE NOT!!!! In a time when people are barely hanging on you feel it's appropriate to increase my bill by nearly 50%. I think not!"

My smart meter has not been reset and showing continuous use and Bill running up including what I've just paid . Please can someone answer back to me on this."
699,Ok so Octopus Energy how do I get your attention? I’ve tried complaining by email/ calls /asked for ‘Tony’ to call me or a manager. Totally ignored. I’ve been trying to swop suppliers for almost four weeks. Seriously poor service 
700,"Useless company - charged me £360 for gas and electric when I wasn’t a customer, have told me it is fixed but it isn’t so it appears I owe money when I should be in credit "
701,"So after having my last years meter readings and energy bills etc sent to you you then said I would be making a saving by switching to you, reduced monthly payments too at £65.00 per month. 
Today after being with you for two months I receive an email saying you need to put my monthly payments up to £175.98 ???  
So I'll be paying way way more than ever before with my last supplier.  
Very disappointed to read on here I'm not the only person this has happened too."
702,Agile energy from your company is creeping up and up in price daily. This is starting one of the biggest rip offs i have ever seen. I have monitored your prices since i went onto this tariff and promises of cheaper energy is total crap. How dare you claim too be the cheapest energy provider when on average now agile energy is getting so very expensive. People like myself are living in fuel poverty but what does your company care about that? The answer is simple you don't give a toss about it. The coronavirus pandemic as made life harder for lots of people including myself. Shame on you and shame on your ceo who thinks of nothing more than profit profit profit. And its also a waste of time talking too your reps who just fob you off with total crap too.
703,I have missed my monthly calls from you through illness could you communicate regarding my current meter readings please
704,"Lurline Fowler Lurline Fowler look at all the bad comments and complaints

708,"I agree with Gordon Martin, absolutely no problems with them."
709,I second above posts what other energy company let's you stop monthly direct debit if your in enough credit to pay for a particular months bill.
710,"Sorted us out with our new build and our meter being switched with our neighbours on the register so we were getting each other's bills.  Was a nightmare to put right being bounced between the different companies and getting nowhere, but when we switched to Octopus they sorted it out by liaising with the other suppliers involved for me and getting it rectified 👍"
711,Likewise I agree with Gordon Martin! Great company that always keeps you informed should you need to adjust your monthly payments..
712,Yes brilliant company second year now no problems just great service 5 stars
713,"Great company, you just need to sort out your app!"

716,Been on to octopus for ages now to sort my account out and have got nowhere since March...

723,Wouldn't want to be with anyone else
724,"We had a good start with Octopus, but we have been made to jump through hoops in order to join your Outgoing Tariff, which we have still not managed after 5 months of back and forward. Travelling at the speed of light or discovering a black hole would be easier... 😩😩😩"
725,Love octopus defo the best supplier for me. The app makes it very easy to monitor my spending and make any necessary adjustments to my payments. Only thing they let me and my mate Gemma Louise down on was not winning some beer in the quiz ☹️ although maybe we built our hopes up too high

727,Excellent company but still waiting for my smart meter.
728,"I’m just waiting to get the smart meters, been told that none available but when I contacted sms plc ( smart meter company ) they say there are appointments in my area, but octopus needs to book the appointment.
I think Octopus are a great company but can’t handle all the new customers they are getting.
"
729,Any news on smart meters in Milton Keynes been waiting since before lockdown started
730,"Been with Octopus Energy for over 3 years now. Requested Smart Meters a few months ago. Had them installed soon afterwards, and had updated reads sent to us on a monthly basis. Definitely a good move. Really pleased with Service and Customer Care."
731,"Had my smart meters installed this week after they were cancelled from April due to Covid, a few messsges/emails to chase but understand the back log as with most things! The Engineer was very courteous stuck to social distancing rules and done a great job. Requested to now switch to octopus Go for charging our EV, been told it'll be a week or so as they need to monitor the smart meters, so fingers crossed 🤞love the vans they look great. Looking forward to receiving my plush toy next month too 🐙"
732,"Hi Octopus, really having an issue with our gas meter. We have waited 10 weeks for the gas meter to be moved for the engineer to finally come out this morning, for him not to be able to move it. I have emailed, privately DMed 🐙 and been on the phone to ask to speak to someone senior to no avail. I rang at 9am. Please can someone contact us. We are beyond annoyed "
733,"I am not sure I would recommend a company that promises to call back and does not and then when you call them they put you on hold for a very long time then cut you off, even worse get through and you get cut off. If you want customers perhaps you should be more customer friendly and call your customers. I am not even a customer of you my belated Father was! Please contact me ASAP I have messaged you!"
734,I'm not getting any answer to my emails or messages. I fear you customer service claimed have gone into free fall
735,Quality program. The Fiat500 was awesome!
736,"Hello,the Octopus sticker has come off my key,please say this won't be an issue as I've got to buy electric to put on it tomorrow."
737,"Hi, I switched to you just over a week ago, first payment came out on 18th. When will I get my £50 sign up bonus for using my friends recommend a friend link? Thanks! "
738,"My parents are having problems with their bills, for some reason you are showing that they have 2 gas meters, you are saying that they now owe money, they have been in touch a few times, they were on the phone for over an hour once and then the girl hung up !! Emails have been sent and no replies. I will message you with their email address and I would be pleased if someone can get in touch with them ASAP to sort out the mess.  They certainly do not need this hassle at the moment!! "
739,"Beyond a joke, after 5 days I’m in tears with frustration trying to get it sorted."

742,I love bellerin
743,
744,Wow❤️❤️❤️
745,One love arsenal family
746,Can I cancel 
747,Wow this is soo interesting ❤️👍
748,"We love you
100% green"
749,Hmmm....if I'd known about this before I switched to you it's possible that I might have chosen another supplier 😁😉 #SpursFanForMySins

751,"10th June messaged this company, still waiting for a reply. Communication is shocking and always has been.!"
752,Great company.  Great service.  Octopus 🐙 Agile is unbeatable. 
753,"we have a fixed contract with octopus until April next year, they have taken double the amount out of my account on two occasions no response from customer services this is fraud and should not have taken this amount out of my account! I do not recommend octopus as a company at all we have had problems with them since signing up"
754,Sophie Miller
755,"Another working week has nearly passed by with no resolution of my billing / refund enquiry, and other questions, what’s more disappointing is that I have had no communication from octopus as requested and agreed would happen. Just not good enough.  All this and I’m still a huge fan of the agile tariff."
756,"Not impressed with this company. You entice customers with low prices, then,  when using the same energy each month, your prices somehow increase. It makes no sense."
757,I hear igloo energy may be worth exploring.
758,Messaged Octopus on Thursday no reply. Is it because the email was asking about a better tariff than I’m currently on?? 🤔 
759,Hi I'm currently on a smart meter can I switch over to you or not?
760,Well I was debating whether to join Octopus but having just read that and as a life time Gunner I think minds made up 😂
761,Been trying for nearly a week to change over and no one knows their arse from their elbow 
762, Would like a free phone number I can call on my mobile and talk to someone as I am not into thinking non human contact 🤨
763,Is it possible to switch on prepayment meter?
764,this is worrying reading these comments.  i’m in the middle of changing to octopus.  think i may cancel
765,I'm a pensioner with disabilities been in total lockdown for four and half months now. I  signed with Octopus in December and live in a high rise storey building in a single bedroom flat. After six months they're forcing me to pay almost doubled per month what my   next door neighbours; a family of four are paying per month!!!. What should I do? I wrote to them but they are still going ahead to increase my Direct debit!!!.
