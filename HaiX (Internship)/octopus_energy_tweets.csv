4,"@newelland @octopus_energy I've also wondered this. I understand their workforce is based on IT skills, rather than big teams of  field /call centre agents. But as a sweeping generalisation, IT folk aren't always known for their people skills - So what happens when something goes wrong?"

As for no HR who does an employee speak to with a complaint against a manager for example of bullying or sexual harassment?"
455,I find it very hard to believe that @octopus_energy which is an information technology company handling sensitive customer information doesn't have an IT department even if they call it something else.
456,"@WelshBluebird @dougalshawBBC @g__j @octopus_energy Conversely I've never, ever, worked somewhat where I felt the HR department would offer me any help or support whatsoever. In purely my experience I have found HR teams to be obsessed with petty minded bureaucracy often at the expense of employee well-being."
457,@octopus_energy hi I now have a Chameleon in home display but it says connection lost any ideas how to get it connected? https://t.co/iXAVQ5Yhr3
458,"@oliverwinton @simonnread @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy @eugenecostello Sounds like your typical director who believes It is simple and can be farmed out to the cheapest bid...
Untill ....."
459,@octopus_energy U raised my bill 50% not even a call 🙄 my bad I haven’t submitted readings for some time! My gas meter is faulty makes me wonder where you got your info 🧐 now not returning emails about faulty meter? It’s all a bit 💩! https://t.co/HlV88v3KhP
460,"This is true collateral damage of an oil driven world, and why we, @Tesla, @elonmusk  @myenergiuk @DeegeSolar @octopus_energy and SO many more are trying so hard to shift towards sustainability immediately!♻️💔 https://t.co/Hu4s6L0Fxb"
461,"@ariadneassoc @octopus_energy Of course HR activity happens through line managers, as does IT one of the other areas mentioned, but it simply becomes a hidden cost. You have line managers who are not experts in specialist subjects devoting time to them and potentially detracting from their 'day jobs'."
462,@LBHF @londoncouncils @StephenCowan @octopus_energy @HelloUpstream @imperialcollege @caffeinepartner @blenheimchalcot Worry less about the thought-leadership strategy &amp; pls focus on fixing #hammersmithbridge ASAP
463,"@court_college @LBHF @londoncouncils @StephenCowan @octopus_energy @HelloUpstream @imperialcollege @caffeinepartner @blenheimchalcot @PutneyFleur @hammersmithandy And while you're at it, let's see the engineers #hammersmithbridge report from the 1990's that told the council that the seized pedestal bearings weren't important and didn't need action."
464,"Would cutting bereaucracy such as having no HR and IT departments, like at @octopus_energy make businesses more efficient? https://t.co/6a20ksThsH"
465,@dougalshawBBC @g__j @octopus_energy He's rather gorgeous isn't he? 😍🐙
466,"@octopus_energy Great, thank you very much!"
467,"@LBHF @londoncouncils @StephenCowan @octopus_energy @HelloUpstream @imperialcollege @caffeinepartner @blenheimchalcot Why is everything called a ""hub"" these days by councillors? Lets have a transport ""bridge hub"" across the Thames into Barnes. lets call this ""hub"" a bridge. Roll eyes."
468,"@octopus_energy @g__j Please do!. To me, good customer service is as important as pricing....maybe moreso! Hence the reason I made the switch. So far, so good. 😁"
469,@LBHF @londoncouncils @StephenCowan @octopus_energy @HelloUpstream @imperialcollege @caffeinepartner @blenheimchalcot Really? @stephenCowan can live up to labour principals of open government and issue the report that closed #hammersmithbridge then furnish us with how he would like it restored and financed? We have all asked over 12 months. @PutneyFleur @hammersmithandy
470,CEO Secrets: 'My billion pound company has no HR department' https://t.co/tsNrFdgfgF @g__j @octopus_energy what a article... more companies should learn
471,"@sunathanlater @dougalshawBBC @g__j @octopus_energy My energy supplier - quick, personalised responses to queries, green energy, bright pink octopus logo - what's not to like!!!"
472,"@octopus_energy Hi there, I've been charged £212 for a month's supply of energy as a parting gift, and seem to be going in circles with the customer service team. AccNo A-11556331."
473,@dougalshawBBC @g__j @octopus_energy Really?  Seems to have a few listed in LinkedIn https://t.co/3vUa6SlpVB
474,"@Bust3d00 @simonnread @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy @eugenecostello I can kind of understand the lack of HR dept, but no IT?! Sounds like an absolute nightmare"
475,"@DaleVince Is having an @ElecHighway that actually works ""pushing the boundaries"" Because it seems to be a step too far for you! Why not just sell it to someone that really wants it too prosper? Like @octopus_energy @g__j"
476,Power to the people. Really interesting views on employee #empowerment #motivation #productivityhabits #efficiency from @octopus_energy founder and CEO Greg Jackson - https://t.co/mKDutwKBIB #businessandmanagement #leadership
477,@dougalshawBBC @g__j @octopus_energy I saw the Octopus Energy one earlier! Great feature. Greg seems like a character
478,"@simonnread @FelicityHannah @eugenecostello @octopus_energy They couldn't see the first one, so I had to point out that there were DM's from them apologising for the charge and confirming it had been removed."
479,"@m7leicauser @octopus_energy @dougalshawBBC @BBCNews I'm sure there's backups somewhere on memory sticks down the back of his desk somewhere.
Cut costs, cut standards"
480,"@PhilipMarshall1 @G_J @octopus_energy It's been escalated, Philip. Will let Maddie take over to fix this!"
481,Credit where its due....massive thanks to the team @octopus_energy for resolving my issue of non working IHD &amp; uncommunicative smart meters. Particularly Gareth J on twitter customer help &amp; the lovely Emily who called a couple of times to check all was OK. Top team! @g__j
482,"@octopus_energy hey, called, emailed, no response! gone from happy customer to pretty annoyed!!!"
483,@simonnread @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy @eugenecostello Just read on BBC they don't have an IT department. So ..
484,@eugenecostello @G_J @octopus_energy I'm the Philip Marshall who has had £4000 applied to my account twice and already has a long running DM conversations with Marti and Helen from customer services.
485,@FelicityHannah @eugenecostello @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy And this is the second time!
486,"@PhilipMarshall1 @G_J @octopus_energy Hi Philip. It seems there are a lot of Philip Marshalls! Can you send a DM to @octopus_energy with your account details? We are taking this very seriously, and a director has asked for you to do this. Or you can email me – eugenecostellojourno AT gmail DOT com 🙏"
487,@eugenecostello @G_J @octopus_energy Thanks
488,"@simonnread @octopus_energy @eugenecostello Dunno. I'd be happy to go and take a look, what with 30 years fixing nonsense like this. Rates to be advised"
489,@eugenecostello @simonnread @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy 4 THOUSAND pounds?! I don't think I've heard of one quite this bad before
490,"@PhilipMarshall1 @G_J @octopus_energy Of course. I am trying to help, Philip. Can you give me a few minutes? Best, Eugene"
491,@simonnread @PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy Hi Si and Philip. I've escalated it. Can you give me a little while to try to get under the hood?
492,"@eugenecostello @G_J @octopus_energy ""Other people's experiences"" don't mean much at the moment"
493,"@octopus_energy @chloehornn1 Hey @octopus_energy 

Thanks for taking this seriously! 👏Can you confirm you will be removing your ads from here?

Please will you also add these sites to your exclusion lists?https://t.co/MjSiJrOt5B"
494,@PhilipMarshall1 @octopus_energy @eugenecostello This is ridiculous. What's wrong with their systems?
495,"@octopus_energy Interesting. The CEO’s equipping and empowerment of line managers is positive. However, employees need an HR colleague to go to with issues they may not feel comfortable talking to their line manager about. https://t.co/dZfkUzpeQR"
496,"@PhilipMarshall1 @G_J It does seem gremlins are picking on you! With 91% rating Octopus excellent (96 if you include great), this is outside most people's experience. I am the in-house journalist for @octopus_energy and can barely change a lightbulb, but I will flag this up to someone who can help 🙏"
497,"@WorldofGoodBook @octopus_energy I'm in favour of people being able to solve problems without HR getting involved (adult-adult mindsets). But you need some level of HR function, even if it's to manage the employment process (especially for a company with over 1k people. 

Outsourcing HR still counts as using it."
498,"It's happened again. £4000 has been charged to our account taking us deep into arrears. I've taken a screen shot this time, so they can't disappear it. I am absolutely sick and tired of having to chase @octopus_energy. @simonnread @eugenecostello https://t.co/0tuhGhnPVO https://t.co/99UqyMgyVV"
499,"How can @octopus_energy keep my personal information safe and maintain data security without an IT department?

Very worried brand new customer here.
