80,"Depression, anxiety, sorrow, guilt is now common today every single person going through this phase because of higher expectations and competition, and don't think all celebrity who on top is only with hardwork there shady side of showbiz which they never reviled. I can't believe they invite this person on this platform which she totally unqualified"
81,I agree both happiness and sadness passes but it is we who are responsible to force sadness to pass away..it won't on its own..no one else can do it for us. Similarly we have to credited for the great deed if makung happiness pass away too..we can hold onto it..there is always an option..always a choice..and we choose to let it pass away

130,"A huge opportunity to educate ourselves on Black history. I love it; and am equally saddened and disturbed by what I learn. As a ghost writer, I have  a few Black clients, so I'm learning all year long. You learn fast when you work closely with others -- and listen to them; and then explore further on your own and never stop. <3  "
131,"A time to learn about history, the black culture, racism (including awareness of my white privilege) and the many contributions and gifts and talents of black peoples especially Americans."
132,Do show black history.. but first American children should be taught in detail native American history the real natives of the American land and shown in television accordingly 
133,"I always thought that Black History Month was in celebration of the accomplishments of African Americans in our history. We all came here in different ways- some sent as punishment; some came and fought for independence; some as indentured servants; some were sold to traders and purchased as slaves; some seeking a better life from oppression. Each group contributed something unique to the building of our great country, and those contributions together form the opportunities and freedoms that we all enjoy today."
134,"The movement, history (Martin Luther King great example) reminder to stay humble"
135,It means that I get to remind my brothers ans sisters the privilege we have to live in an era that was once a vision for my ancestors that risked their lives and paved the way for us to be able to walk  and embrace our diverse nature and share mother earth with one another United once and for all eventhough we are still fighting it's a reminder for us all to never forget where we came from and the  essence of history
136,"Black History “Month” is just a reminder to me of my everyday, 365 day a year, 12 MONTHS per year journey as a descendant of enslaved Africans who BUILT this country and are and continue to be, an integral part of the history of the United States of America.  From enslaved Africans to entrepreneurs.  From oppressed and excluded to inclusive and successful.  The fabric of culture in the United States could NOT be what is today, and what we all know it to be, and experience it to be, without recognizing and embracing the contributions of our people.  “Black” History is the United States of America’s History.  The two can NOT be separated."
137,"There shouldn't have to be ""black history month"" or ""indian"" ""mexican"" ""asian"" etc. history, because it should ALL be taught together, because it is ALL our history!"
138,It means having genuine conversation about the African people and the African continent. It's fostering healing. Retelling the African story. It's taking responsibility on the part of the West and loose the neo-colonial grip that is still chocking Africa through sponsored war and oppressive policies. It's accepting responsibility that too much damage was done by the West that eroded Africas Human dignity. The indoctrination and brainwashing can only be eliminated by right education in our schools.
139,"We did not yet have Black History month when I was in school.
I have much to learn, at 64."
140,It means acknowledging the systems of oppression that black people were and are under and emphasizing the need to fix them
141,it's a chance to learn things and form a more complete understanding of another's experience. it's also a chance to show support for a more inclusive and respectful society
142,"It is a reminder how divided we still are, and that until we start celebrating human history month, nothing will ever change."
143,More blatant racism
144,Morgan Freeman on Black history month with Don Lemon. I agree with Mr. Freeman.
145,"America had failed our people .  Yes a celebration /awareness should be BUT why. Were we all taught  untruths where POC  had not lived . 
America is the land of opportunity-  POC havens been discussed in history  
Why. (Rhetorical) 
I am glad that  black history is being celebrated . But inform and change  history books to reflect  all POC 
❤️"
146,So much ignorance here. 
147,".
His story 
like all others 
can be viewed from many perspectives"
148,A good time to listen; w the intention to hear rather than respond. 
149,It means that black history is only promoted 1/12 of a year where as it should be 12/12 of a year.
150,F**  all we are still here making history. Ain’t no one subjecting me to one month a year 
151,It means that black history still isn't being taught enough in schools if it was would we need a single month out of 12 to ensure people have an understanding of black history?
152,We should commemorate very promising lives cut short and destroyed by incarceration.
153,World history month- we should let go of the cultures and differences and just love ❤️

It floats into the air, absorbed with new energy flowing thru the awakened spirit  from your  deep sleep.

236,This illustrates the platform that I'm involved with right now.  It's an educational platform for entrepreneurs which allows people to earn money while they learn skills.  Valuable skills to help build and grow spiritually and to rid ourselves of paradigms which no longer serve us.  The Freedom Era is somewhat like MindValley in that we attract some of the greatest minds to teach us to uplevel and become better human beings but we have the advantage of leveraging social media at the same time while doing so.  I love what you are doing with MindValley.  You have helped me so much.  I go to bed every night and wake up every morning to Jose Silva's meditations.  Thank you for introducing me these concepts.
237,I’m an educator and I agree 100% in what  Matthew says. Words of wisdom from a well experienced individual. Excellent.
238,"Matt, 

Love your view on education. I totally believe school needs to look different. But we need to start in the right place. Teach our teachers to do a new way. They get stuck in the rut of doing things the old way. My son is Autistic and not one darn teacher he has had can teach him anything but me. Thank God I was able to stay home with him and teach him the things he needed to know.  But how many mothers out there cry themselves to sleep wishing they could do more for thier children. I was on of them until I spent the 2nd chapter in my life helping my kiddo and many others kiddos for free. My sin will not graduate the same as everyone else's kids. He will hVe to opt for a GED because our educational system sucks in every way.   I wish I could change the world. Because my son is perfect the way he is. Thanks for always being so open to help others. It warms my heart that there are still people out there willing to help others. "
239,"His book “Greenlights” is a fantastic read, highly recommend. 👍"
240,Matthew- look up and hook up with Ted Dintersmith.  His support for schools on Molokai and across the country have allowed many of us in the trenches to create much more meaningful things our kids will remember and take with them forever.  Put it into action!
241,Very profound and powerful 
242,Awesome 👏 🌟
243,Particularly in my field of engineering a university degree purely shows you have the ability to learn. It constitutes 1% of what you need in the working industry. Attitude and desire to apply yourself is what makes the individual successful in the workplace. Its a grind and its tough. Any graduate that comes out of the system and expects to gifted a job is going to be left behind.

303,"Not easy to get in touch with Mindvalley at all. Have resorted to commenting on here to get my views heard. I watched the masterclass with Vishen, John and Missy about the Lifeplan course. It was very misleading to say that the  course was being offered for free, when in fact you had to pay the fee first, complete the course and then apply for a refund. That is not my definition of free and very disappointing for someone like me who  cannot afford the fee required. I feel this should have been made clear from the outset, not after having watched so much of the masterclass in vain."

345,"Really disappointed Vishen, I admired your interviews with some great achiever’s. I thought the bar of mind valley is really high in terms of knowledge and tools we get with some brilliant minds from all over the world. But Priyanka? That sounds manipulative and will decrease your fan base. "
346,"Dear Priyanka,

Recently I read the book 📚 “Green-lights” by Mathew Mac Conaughey and saw his interview with Vishen life. 
I must say I was curious about what you would say. I had never heard about you. After reading your book “unfinished “ , I thought I should write a few words. 
We all have a life path. And life paths of each and every one are different. We can not judge any decision anyone makes in her or his life. Moreover I think any decision in life gets us where it gets us. Question is always, what do we learn, what did we learn? Do we change?
I honestly am impressed by the support and cooperation of your parents and family. This is the kind of support I would have liked. But then again my life path was a different one. 
I honestly believe that a lot of drama and trauma could be prevented if this kind of upraising was standard procedure for all of mankind. And again this is not something I can choose or change. But it is a very good example! 

Thank you for that! 🙏
Wishing you success in life and your career!

398,"I think his compass  is pointed in the right direction. Where are the tools though? You can describe a word and it’s meaning metaphorically, but application is a whole other thing. Hence knowledge vs. wisdom.
He’s describing “probable” language. Not only that which we speak to others but subconsciously speak to ourselves. Here’s the thing... if you’re speaking “non-truths” to yourself or others... “unbelievable”, “probably”, “maybe”, “try”.... then you’re self sabotaging your own consciousness and subconcious. Like he said use the right adjectives ... say what you mean... and practice awareness of your thoughts and words.... that’s just the start by the way....
The “ideals” are great, the “power of positive thinking” is great...
But it falls short of the most mechanically inclined without the tools... shown, taught, executed, supported, and held accountable. Life Coaching 101 "

We  urge  your urgent attention as our democratically elected leaders including State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, President Win Myint along with senior government officials, and the  elected members of parliament have now been detained by the military.

We need your urgent appropriate action and intervention to stop this military coup to protect the people of Myanmar (Burma) and the democratically elected National League for Democracy Government.

Kami mendesak perhatian mendesak Anda karena para pemimpin kami yang terpilih secara demokratis termasuk Penasihat Negara Aung San Suu Kyi, Presiden Win Myint bersama dengan pejabat senior pemerintah, dan anggota parlemen yang terpilih sekarang telah ditahan oleh militer.

Hinihimok namin ang iyong kagyat na pansin dahil ang aming mga piniling demokratikong pinuno kabilang ang State Counsellor Aung San Suu Kyi, Pangulong Win Myint kasama ang mga nakatatandang opisyal ng gobyerno, at ang mga nahalal na miyembro ng parlyamento ay nakakulong na ngayon ng militar. Mangyaring pinapayuhan na tulungan ang aming bansa sa pamamagitan ng pagtigil sa coup ng militar na ito dahil nangyayari ito ngayon sa Myanmar (Burma).

Ang partido ni Aung San Suu Kyi ay nanalo ng isang malaking tagumpay sa nagdaang halalan at ang bagong parlyamento ay dahil sa magsisimula sa mga susunod na oras.

Kailangan namin ang iyong kagyat na naaangkop na aksyon at interbensyon upang ihinto ang coup ng militar na ito upang protektahan ang mga tao ng Myanmar (Burma) at ang demokratikong nahalal na National League para sa Pamahalaang Demokrasya.

As a certified Health, Nutrition and Life Coach I have seen that this is one of the first things to address. Our beliefs about food and examining our relationship to eating. Loved what has been covered in this masterclass; the connection of our breath to our emotional state, to our beliefs and our whole relationship to food. 💜💜"
586,"Gentlemen Vishen:
1.- There is no teaching-learning process, since there is no interaction between the knowledge provided and the student's contention on the path of assimilation of knowledge
2.- The learning process does not have a tutor, to give greater security to the student. All learning in higher education has a tutor who accompanies the student in the course process.
3.- There is talk of developing, it is true, everything starts at will, but from the beginning of the world an apprentice has a Living Teacher, not a recording, not even artificial intelligence to answer emails. I want Mindvalley to respect its Advertising promise, ""if you don't like the course we will refund your money."" MY will is that I want humanity, not recordings and if you cannot offer live online classes with a teacher who can answer my learning concerns; then, my will requires the return of my $ 299.
4.- Being a Master in quality management of services and products, I am used to evaluating education services and my experience with you does not go and I will publish my experience evaluating each access point and response to the sale of a service. My name is Ana María Agüero Sáenz and I took my course on January 31, 2021 and I don't want it because they ARE NOT Live Classes.

624,"This is exactly what I need and what I’m struggling with today. I grew up with a narcissistic parent, which I didn’t even realize until I was in my late 30’s and had lost EVERYTHING I had ever dreamed of and wanted for my life to a long term relationship with the father of my children, who after a single therapy session (after a thousand before that) explained to me what it really meant to be abused by a narcissist. After looking back I can now see that mostly all of the “friendships” and “romantic relationships”I’ve been in, were with the same type of people. I grew up believing, deep down in my inner core that there was something inherently wrong with me. I accepted and I guess, expected it because it’s how I believed I NEEDED to be treated. I might even go as far as to say, even if I didn’t love or like them and I knew that they didn’t love me, I felt safe when I had them in my life! It’s crazy, right? Talk about NEEDING to be reprogrammed! 
Right now I’m enrolled in a similar, targeted program for people who have PTSD due to this abuse and it involves slowing down brain waves, getting to the subconscious and superconscious mind, and quantum healing, meditation... I pay half of what I would here, but I know that I have to be more committed to the program in order to change but I allow the problems that come up in my daily life to guide me. Goals??? That’s a joke because I have things that I know I want and are actually more attainable than ever before but I allow things to happen to me (my days are decided for me because SOMETHING ALWAYS comes up that causes me so much anxiety that by the end of the day, I have accomplished nothing and I feel like I’m a hamster in a spinning wheel. 
I NEED to learn how to rise above the challenges that come my way JUST to be able to start to heal... otherwise I am throwing $55/m down the toilet! I would love to invest in this program because I do believe that we should do something every day that our future self will thank us for and that investing in ourselves is the best investment we can make... but I have to learn how to make it a part of my day, every single day, not just once a month when I have an hour drive, by myself (without my daughter playing her iTunes playlists!)"

681,"Prayer to protect you and cures covid-19: 
“Our Lord, we have wronged ourselves, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we certainly would be of the losers.”. And after repenting they should say: “Oh Allah, I am Your servant, I ask you by the fact there is no God except You, and by the fact of Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf, and by the fact of greatness of the Bliss of YourSelf’s good-pleasure that is greater than the bliss of Your heavenly-garden that you heal me from the chastisement of corona or remove it away from me surely I believe in the true caller from You. Oh Allah, remove Your chastisement away from us and from every entrance so we would follow the path of Truth from You, and to make us steadfast on fulfilling what we promised You — O Who comes between man and his heart, surely we do not have except Your mercy that You ordained upon YourSelf. Indeed, if You do not forgive us and (not) have mercy on us we would surely be of the losers. Oh our Allah, You have said in Your decisive Book: {And your Lord says: Pray to Me, I will answer you.}Truthful Allah the Great [Ghãfer] 40:60. Supplication-prayer and turning (close to Allah) is from me while responding is from You. Indeed, You never violate Your promise. Our Lord, glory be to You, surely Your promise is ever True and You are the Most Merciful than all who have mercy. O our Allah, make us steadfast upon fulfilling what we promised You to follow Allah’s global caller khalifa of Allah in the land; the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni. O our Allah, make sending him as favor upon us and not affliction against us because of our turn away from the true call of the Imam Mahdi Nasser Mohammad Al-Yemeni”.

717,When we forgive someone we accept he or she has done something wrong but it has no effect on our existence. We must forgive so that we can realize how kind we are. Forgiveness reflects our kindness. This kindness can't change the person whom we forgive but it obviously change our own state of being. Forgiveness expands our vision on kindness.

They did it to us and for us... 

to give us a chance to become who we were meant to become. The chance for our greatness.

We choose. Either it will break us or make us.

755,"Life is fun when there is someone you love, someone to spend your time with, someone to share a meal, someone to tell your secrets. I remember the moment when I decided to let go of Sfiso because of his bad habits, all the work I was doing seemed useless. My daughter used to ask why daddy was coming home late and why we were no-longer sitting on the dining table to share a plate. It was clear that my husband was having an appointment with someone he didn't want us to befriend.
I was heart broken when I found out that he was sleeping with my own friend Thembi. I found this out when I was at the saloon that my own friend was boosting about how she is the one eating my cake now. I didn't know what to do, fight off Thembi or divorce Sfiso and take care of my two children since they were now grown. The distance between me and Sfiso increased, the rumors made it tense. One day I decided to face Sfiso and say it in his face and to my surprise he wasn't shocked at ll and he even told me he could have as many women as he wished for. I was confused and needed help. I consulted with different psychologists, our religious leaders, from family members and friends that is where I was advised to consult Mama Baker  that She could help solve my problem(end my nightmare). I was given his contact and decided to call her. she listened to me and said she would help me by making the Lost Love Spell since I was still in love with my man.
I couldn't travel all the way from Durban to Sandton during the lock-down and I was wondering how this was going to be possible. He told me that we can make the spell online i.e she can cast the spell at the Altar and direct me on what to do. I listened and followed her directions. I paid 2000 rand for the materials to be used for the spell to Mama's account. she streamed the casting of the spell to me early in the morning.
On the day of casting the spell, Thembi my sworn enemy came to my apartment and I called Mama Baker before  letting her in because I was surprised where she had got the guts to come to my home. Mama said I should let her in at once and listen to what she has to say. I told the security to allow her to come in. She came at a time when me and Sfiso had not yet left for work. She said openly "" Am sorry sisi I didn't mean to ruin your life, forgive me for cheating on your husband"" then she said to Sfiso in-front of me that she was fed up of their relationship and was moving on to find someone for herself. I was stunned, so I decided to call Mama Baker to explain what was going on, she said that the spell had made Thembi realize that she was in the wrong position and needed to let go of my man. Sfiso too was guilty and made me an apology with a brand new E350 to show that he was really sorry for his actions.
All this wouldn't have been possible without the help of Mama Baker (+27655918270 "

776,Merlin Hallock   this is what ive started working on  
777,"Everyone deserves forgiveness simply because people only know to treat others or understand another as well as they have treated themselves or as far and as deeply have understood themselves. Knowing this one simple thing can be a game changer for those who are forgiving because forgiveness liberates both the person who inflicts and the one who suffers. Currently during distancing, as we spend the better parts of our time on screen working, communicating, conversing, and connecting, when we log off we realize how sapped we are and much of pent up feelings of past difficulties or past traumas or challenges could come up for release. I am looking forward to going deeper and learning about the nuances of the methods of forgetting. Only retaining the lessons learned, not the drama and agony themselves especially if in the present moment when trying to keep our vibe high and soul tribe close, little and big things trigger memories of past trauma. Whether generational or of a single life time from childhood, friendships etc. How to gradually mute and erase those triggers because ultimately we each are a work in progress. In my world of the healers, we call it deep shadow work. I eagerly look forward to what the master teachers here at the awesome Mindvalley have to say about the subtle art of forgetting.🙏💜🙏"
778,Thats really eye opener...Good one sonia thx
779,"No, forgiving without first healing is false forgiveness, a method preferred by those who hurt us in the past and usually continue to hurt us in the present. That's based on dissotiation."

911,"Hello everyone, am here to testify about the greatest spiritual healer that helped me believe in life again after my husband had left me for another woman.Life has been so difficult for me these past few months and I had given up on myself knowing that I will not find love or true happiness again. Two months ago I found out I was pregnant and I was so happy and excited to have my own baby and I didn't even call my boyfriend. I just wanted to take the results to him and show him face to face and share the good news together. But when I reached his flat I saw his car parked outside and knew he was home so I went straight to his room. When I knocked, he allowed me to enter because he wasn't expecting me at the time, but when i opened the door I nearly fainted because I caught him ready handed with another woman in his house. I looked at them and closed the door and ran away, he followed me saying his sorry and the woman is just a friend and nothing else but I knew he was lying and I walked away. I reached home and cried a lot until i told my best friend everything and she told me to fight for my man and not loose him to another woman. She gave me Baba Isma's contact +27783320386 and told me Baaba will bring back my boyfriend to me and love only me. So i contacted Baaba and told him everything, he made a love and binding prayers for me and in 2 days of the prayers my boyfriend came to me with that woman I saw him with and knelt down and begged for my forgiveness and told the woman that am the love of his life and he doesn't ever want to see her again. The woman walked away and that evening my man came back with a baked cake and gifts and flowers and asked for my forgiveness again and promised never to hurt me again and I told him that we are having a baby, he cried and smiled with joy and happiness. We are back together and so much in love and waiting for our baby to arrive. Thanks so much your prayers indeed work. You can call or whatsapp Baaba Isma +27783320386 incase you are passing through the same situation. Don't be discouraged by what people may tell you"

And I can't even get to the Jon&Missy Butcher classess because I don't got $500 so to earn them back after I get to successfully finish the class. You really got the most awesome things I've ever seen. Every $ is freaking worth all the value!! But the point is when you are on the edge that you literally can't afford almost anything, you are like tied up your both hands! My phone can't even take some cool photos so I sell a bunch of pictures or something... I may miss these offers now, but I am deffinetely NOT giving up on trying. I really think I should start the year with Jon and Missy classes. The Masster class with them was a masterpiece, can't really imagine the whole program. 🍀🍀🍀 Wish me luck in the next some months I get my goals done! (I sure hope there is stuff about procrastination). If I get the chance to enroll for free I shall save 2 months for that (yeah, I do know that the program is 7 weeks - a little less than 2 months). This is not the first time you give it for free (well, almost, I do know that the people must have motivation or reason to go through the whole program). You should probably also invite Brendon Burchard for his High Performance Habits for a Masterclass ❤️. Happy and successful new year! 🍀🍀"

1129,I learnt a lot from a nutritionist this year. As a type 2 diabetic with fibromyalgia I had to fight to get to see a diabetic consultant. I was given the wrong advice by a gp nurse for 10 years. I had to research myself and refuse to move until I got a referral. I was lucky to see a fab specialist for the fibromyalgia. Zero pharma drugs and I’m now in hardly any pain. As for the diabetes I was on tablets and 4 injections a day.... through diet only I take a hormone..... that’s it!

I was checking the labels on the products that the are no sugar and I spotted that they put more dangerous substances as aspartame or other ""E"" selection or they are putting so confusing name of the sweeteners that they are more dangerous that normal sugar... Just be aware of it please 😉 all the best for whole mindvalley team!"
1148,"Its accurate Vishen, except the juice comparisson that you made.
Sugars are very high in fruit juices by their nature, and if they are from the actual fruit, they are good for us and our health. So these are probably from the natural sugars of the orange itself, since they say there is no added sugar.
If the sugars are coming from the actual white/brown sugar that we know, it is to be avoided in large amounts, thats correct.
If the sugars are coming from the actual fruit, it is what our body really wants, and the best and the healthiest for us.
The label that says ""No sugar added"" implies that there is no White/Brown processed externalized sugar in the product.
And this works for all the products too.
There are many forms of sugars. The natural sugars of the food, and the processed externalized sugars. 
You want to be very disciplined with your processed externalized sugars.
This is some clarified Nutrition that may help.
We could also use the term ""carbohydr"" and ""Glycemic Index""
The orange fruit is full of good carbs, (like all plants and fruits and legumes and grains), and it is with very high Glycemic Index, which means that it will go very fast in your blood stream, and will give you immediate benefit and that it will nurture you fast. 
Other fruts like the pear, have very low Glycemic Index, which means it will be progressively supplying your body for longer period, with the good carbs. Essential natural carbs in both cases. One goes fast, one goes slowly in our blood stream.
These are the natural sugars that we spoke about. 
Do never worry for the natural sugars/carbs that the natural food has, ever in your life, it is what is best for you and your health and your wellness.
You can learn some basic information of the different Glycemic Index levels for the best and right use of the foods.

***The self-discipline level that you need to eat righteously, will always be in the game, and it is on the first priority. This is just some scientific good knowledge, dont use it to be undisciplined with your food.
Peace and blessings"
1149,One has to learn to read the ingredients and the amount.Knowledge about the ingredients is also important.

1194,"Coming from a christian background, i never believed in Spiritualists or ever imagined that i would get the help of a traditional healer/sangoma. Having been employed for 6 years in the same position, training new comers that join the company, get promoted and am still stuck in the same position no matter how hard i worked or applications i place in every time there was an opportunity, this got me so stressed.At home it was not any different, my relationship was sour, we had tried for 3 years to conceive but in vain. I visited so many hospitals, used various herbs but still never conceived and husband was seeking a separation because of the family pressure,one day on social media my long time friend living in DURBAN got in touch with me,a few days later i opened up to her about what was happening in my life,she advised me to try this powerful traditional healer that had helped sometime back,i hesitated at first because i did not like the idea of going to a traditional healer,i thought for a while about contacting this person, then decided to give it a try, so i called Him, lucky for me he was available to see me and he was in the same country.Long story short,he helped me a lot,i got a much better job position in the company i had long wanted to work in,with a very good pay, my husband paid lobola at home, our wedding is this year and i am soon setting up my first side big business(Beauty Shop) anywhere i want. I must say my perception was totally wrong, if you need help too don't wait till its too late contact Dr profisma on +27783320386 WhatApp"

1242,"The fruit juice image you provided is incorrect. That juice nutrition facts label is the sugar in the water stored in the fruit. When fruit is juiced the water and all of the sugar comes with it. Because of the serving size the sugar quantity can seem like a lot. However the key thing is that THAT label you showed had zero added sugars, so no one added any sugar to that juice like the video suggested. That is the natural sugar of the fruit, no different than if you were to juice a carrot or broccoli you will get the sugar from those vegetables. If you are going to be critical of some fruit juices (which some are justified) you better pick a bad one, and show the ingredients which are no good for oneself. Otherwise you are speaking generically about all fruit juices and demonizing them. 
Juices from concentrate = not the best idea, juice not from concentrate = better.  Fresh juice is best. Yes it is true that since juice doesn’t have any fiber (which is what you should be saying in the video) the body will absorb have a sugar spike compared to one that is eating fruit with fiber which slows the absorption of sugar. NOW, fruit juices are more than just sugar, fruits still have nutrients, vital water, trace minerals, phytochemicals, and more. Don’t engage a marketing tactic reducing fruits to just sugar. Drinking a quality fruit juice is better than drinking a juice with fillers, and a better option than drinking a coke, energy drink or something else. Go after the garbage beverages, not nature’s food. People don’t eat enough fruits to begin with and you are encouraging people not to eat any for most of the year through the wildfit program. Fruits are nature’s food and are there to heal us from the junk we put in our body. In the ancient days we had no choice but to not eat fruit at a given time, now we are globalized and our bodies are sick and need of healing. Fruits provide that healing in ways the industry doesn’t want us to know and has discredited in the past. We are in a different era, and need long term bodily healing, not simply the short term of cutting out processed food, salt, added sugars, oils, and the like. For someone with chronic illnesses fruits are healing and should be consumed frequently. The whole fruit is preferred, smoothie is second, and juice is third. If I may point you to a resource Mindvalley, I would encourage you to look into the Medical Medium, and the information he received from spirit, or what you may call your higher guidance, or the other reality you tap into. His guidance has helped me heal from my ulcerative colitis, when nothing else would. And yes I eat healthy, I was a whole food plant based vegan for two years prior. A good high fat/protein plant based diet is what got me sick and after reducing my fat intake considerably I feel better and my colon is healed. I may be a single anecdote, but a way of eating should be evaluated on its ability to heal. Not simply feeling fit, or sexy again. Compared the standard American diet to any method of eating which encourages many plants will get you feeling fit and sexy again and 100x better because your body will be nourished like it should have always been if we ate from nature, and not from factories."
