I would like to say a massive thank you to HSBC and the telephone staff! Someone was using my card and you help me thorough the process of stopping it immediately! You were friendly and efficient! I will always bank HSBC 
"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"
If you would send me the neccesary number I would use online services but I have been waiting 2 weeks with no help
"Just past 1 hour waiting again, for the 3rd time.   \n\nCustomer service ZERO"

Brilliant x
Absolutely fuming. Been sat on hold for almost 3 hours on your telephone lines just to be able to change my withdrawal limit. I will be registering a complaint and withdrawing my money forthwith. 
I would love to donate again this year. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out
Is it possible you can answer telephones in less than 2hrs and actually help businesses that create your wealth ?
They card take long to be opne
"@hsbc_uk I have had the worst banking experience of my life. After 16 years of banking with you, I will be closing all of my accounts on Monday. The way I\u2019ve been treated by you is disgusting. I needed to transfer some money urgently and I\u2019ve been made to wait till I can go into a branch on Monday. Why am I made to go into a branch in the middle of a pandemic. Why can\u2019t you be diligent enough to do your checks online. I am so disappointed with your services. You have no issues taking my money but when it comes to taking it back from you, it becomes a war. People need to avoid this bank. I will be posting on all social media platforms. Disgusting behaviour! "
"Complaint \nHi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it\u2019s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar"
Call in the evening is the suggestion but of\nCourse they go home at 6pm. Worst service I have ever received from anyone. 
Notice how they haven\u2019t replied to anyone?\U0001f923\U0001f923\U0001f923
"Yes, no good if you're trying to make an online payment but can't receive a one time access code because you don't have a mobile signal! HSBC need to recognise this problem and offer the option to receive the code via a landline. Other banks offer this option!"
"Why are you not dealing with money stolen from a personal account???\nMy relative has been fobbed off when asking for help when over \xa3700 was taken from his personal account in two transactions whilst he slept, he has spent hours on the phone pleading for an explanation and help as to why your security mobile banking system  has failed and only being told to accept the money is gone and it's not HSBC  s fault. \U0001f621\U0001f621"
"I am beginning to believe you do not want new business. After applying for an account, my partner was drip fed requests for further information, all of which have been provided. Now when she  logs in it says they cannot find an  active application! Was on hold so long the music stopped, then an overseas ring tone started after an hour and 14 mins it cut off. \U0001f621Tried chat - 1hr 25 mins so far. Our local branch is staffed by experienced competent personnel who are currently twiddling their thumbs - but we can't open accounts in branch, we have to use an online system that is clearly broken. The account is needed for a her work as a freelancer but never dreamed it would be this difficult or painful."

"Scam...? Really your bank is a Scam I have had money taken out of my account numerous times this last year unauthorised, and I get told that it can\u2019t be refunded back into my account, this is ridiculous now beyond a joke every time I cancel and block my card then it happens again. Been with you guys 20+ years but you do nothing about this not even return my money that\u2019s been taken... you should be ashamed of yourselves!!!"
"Need to sort out bounce back loans not cycling events, we applied on the 16th June and still nothing!! not good enough when been a long standing business customer "
"You sent me an letter explaining about new overdraft procedures, one of which doesn't make any sense! How can you be charged 19.90%ear variable when you go up to an overdraft limit but not get charged when you go beyond that limit? If that's the case then I'll go beyond the agreed overdraft limit and you won't be able to charge me!"
How about stop worrying about whether I am bank riding and try provide a half decent banking service.  Benn trying to open a business account for over 2 months.  After speaking to numerous people and been assured business managers would give me a call am still waiting.  Come on HSBS the rest of us are trying to get the economy working - being told they not working is also a poor excuse
"Waiting now for this \u2018bank\u2019 to sort an obvious fraudulent international transaction of over \xa31,000+ to an Indian company?? Sat on the phone, again, on hold for 40 min (still waiting) for the 7th time trying to get this sorted. One month tomorrow the money left the account. Money is not safe. Call centre in Mumbai? How can we trust people\u2019s accounts have not been compromised? Anyone else, I wonder, who are, suffering this? "
Worst service: two staff members that don\u2019t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n
"HSBC has for no reason just blocked me from my business account, fighting to save 200 jobs, but what do they care. The account has always been in credit, but what do they care...  If covid does not get us HSBC will...  what awful people..."
Always nothing but problems HSBC I hope all these issues get solved but I also will make sure everyone knows that because of your mistakes even bank of Canada agree u have left a very sick boy at 10 with no medical care. This is serious guys still weeks of trying everything to sort my end and huge phone bills still no luck just lies! Guys this needs to stop hope your big boys at top all having nice weekend I am trying to keep my kid alive u jokes
This bank is so useless that it doesn\u2019t have even international transferring the money on the application and the silly explanation they have is because of the security all the other banks have this and security are fine\nIt means HSBC security a really bad then
"Hey HSBC. I've heard you will close accounts of those refusing to wear a mask in your banks. Can you confirm please as I have taken a loan out for \xa38500 with you and am really looking forward to you being in breach of contract with me when you refuse my cash, in bank repayments.  Should I forget about the loan now or will you change your fascistic policy? Cotton and paper masks do NOTHING to stop the spread of cold and flu viruses and you greedy bankers should keep to banking instead of foisting such measures upon your customers.....and if you are a customer scared of this virus then please stay home and leave us healthy people to get on living our lives."
"HSBC should know all about this. Mexico, Brazil... Biggest fraud in the UK is how HSBC treat 52,000 of their former Midland Bank staff pensioners. They  certainly didn't explain clawback and glibly told people they would get a 2/3 final salary pension. Lies! Now clawing back up to 30% from the lowest paid. Time to do the right thing HSBC and drop clawback. I doubt Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn or anybody in a senior post will ever read this and they certainly seem to only have their own best interests at heart. Interesting that the bank's pension trustees are contacting people to put themselves forward as a pension scheme trustee but have pointedly not contacted any of the clawback campaign committee."
I am suspicious of you not picking up your mortgage overpayment phone line to keep charging me your crazy interest rates!! 15 minutes waiting and counting! You are supposed to be a major bank you can do better than that!
"Channel 4 News interviewing HSBC about the environment.  HSBC invests in tropical rainforest destruction.  And they talk about action, action, action.  Hypocrisy, hypocrisy, hypocrisy more like!!!!!"
Stay safe our HSBC familia
"Yeah, stay away from HSBC"
Terrible bank avoid!!
Sent you a few IM's as per instructions from HSBC Premier.   Would appreciate it if you could read and respond.

It is now a month since we applied for a Business current account - status has been 'Application Pre-approval in progress' now for over 2 weeks - any idea how long until we hear??
I LOVE HOW I GET TOLD THAT I WILL GET CALL BACKS FROM COMPLAINTS/DISPUTES TEAMS AND NEVER DO!!
Appalled and utterly dissapointed at how terrible hsbcs customer service has become. Wasting a vast amount of my time and repeatedly giving me the wrong information. \nWhat caused this level of incompetence and uselessness?

"I have been a customer with HSBC for over 20 years, and the service I have got is beyond appalling. I have been waiting for over 18 weeks for my business account to be opened, I have been promised week after week that it will be open next week, so I have waited. I have a time sensitive grant that will run out next week, which I need for my business and has to be put into a business account. I am having to do all the extra work of managing business finances in my current account so it doesn\u2019t get mixed up. No one is giving me any clear answers. You have pushed my business to the edge."
Hours on hold for fraud department! So much for urgency!!!! Infuriating \U0001f621
Still waiting for a call with an explanation 2 months after fraudulent transactions were made on my account
London and Birmingham are the best place for scam criminals all over UK.
"So disappointed with HSBC.  My daughter has just reported a fraud on her account and has spent two days on the 'phone trying to get it resolved.  ""Halifax"", on the other hand, who were also involved have been fantastic"
"Hey, im trying to open an account online but it doesnt seem to work, i got this message but no email or sms arrived so i tried doing everything again the same and it said that you will contact me by phone but noone did...i want to open an account with you so i can move 40 thousand pounds from a sold property abroad..."
This bank is useless they are so slow and tell you one thing then later on contradict themselves all the time
"Just had a message from you stating that you have tried to call.

Any chance of an e mail address let's face it ! How can you have internet banking and no e-mail address for inquiries
still waiting for  ridiculous fee charged for foreign transaction wrote to you at least 6times on internet banking not one response
How about teaching them about how you knowingly facilitate fraudulent organisations? https://bbc.in/2ZTxvts

I have literally been on this phone for over 1hour and 15 minutes... asked for information that I need to help with getting money back to my company... I know the same amount of information before starting the phone call. This is flipping ridiculous. 
"HSBC have lost \xa315k of my money following a transfer from Santander. Despite the evidence from Santander\u2019s system showing that it was accepted by HSBC. Spent all day on the phone to them and ended up in tears as was so distraught. I\u2019m so stressed. My money has been missing since the 15th Dec. My formal complaint also got me nowhere. My only recourse is through the Ombudsman, so that\u2019s where I\u2019m going tomorrow. An absolute shambles \U0001f621\U0001f621"

"Nearly 5 hrs on hold to the fraud line, I don\u2019t know how much longer I can wait"
THERE IS ALWAYS AN EXCUSE WITH HSBC - FIRST COVID 19 - NOW TYPHOONS - JUST KEEP GOING - SO IF I HAVE TO LIQUIDATE MY ACCOUNT I WILL AND THEN YOU CAN TAKE THE DEBT. BECAUSE IM SICK OF WAITING HOURS ON THE PHONE TO TALK ABOUT THE SAME THING OVER AND OVER AND OVER
"Your fraud team are a joke, when you get the trauma of somebody managing to spend almost \xa32,000 from your account and desperatley trying to speak to somebody you can actually understand and that can actually understand what you are trying to tell them after 90 minutes is crazy.. Then when it all finally sinks in you don't want to know as I managed to get my money back from the company the transactions were made too myself, even though the company has an address and a phone number of the person that did it, neither you or the Police are interested.. Totally bizarre"
"Inbox me please, it\u2019s been 6 days since you decided not to reply to me "
Hi hsbc can you tell me what's going off I can't get through after spending over an hour . Can I have a response please.\n failing that I will go through LinkedIn and get a response from head office  also ask why social media not doing their job properly
This is  ridiculously stupid who ever in this company decided to stop debit cards from your saving accounts . What if I was a senior citizen and had no internet access to register . I have been with you for over 30 years and feel very angry.  
"Unbelievable. Whilst still waiting for HSBC to refund my holiday cancellation some 6 months later, and not able to get through on the phone, I've been told that they wont even investigate or deal with a complaint until they have reviewed the claim. No timescales given! Appalling service. Anyone else with the same problem?"

Your fraud department is exactly that...a fraud! 
I\u2019ve spent at least 8 hours on hold every day this week and still haven\u2019t spoken to anyone from the APP scam department. This is not an exaggeration. If I was allowed to post pictures on here I\u2019d be adding a screenshot of my call logs. \nIn what way is this justifiable?
I waited for 49 min and was cut off ... so disappointed
XKirsty Gallacher
Never had an issue with HSBC. Keep up the good work \U0001f44d\U0001f44d
Still no contact from \nKERRI MILLS AND HER CUSTOMER SERVICE TEAM\nWhat do customers have to do to get anything resembling customer service??\nMr Hugh Pugsley- Counsel-what do we have to do?\nWithout customer service Banks have nothing\nMr Noel Quinn \u2013CEO-What do we have to do?\nIF GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE MEANS SOMETHING TO YOU\nDo not repeat do not BANK with HSBC\nOtherwise you will end being treated like my 83 year old father\n
Sort your appalling customer service out before wishing people Happy Christmas. 
Well done.
"For more protection against fraud, don't use HSBCs online banking and don't trust their incompetent fraud department that blocks your transactions but allows fraudulent transactions and does nothing because they expect you to know all about it"
Always rude on the phone!
No you\u2019re not \nWe cannot get a response from you let alone help
Wished they spent more time answering phones than posting adverts as I've been on hold for hours on end as they say to call them regarding fraud on my account when I get through can't understand lady on the other end then they put phone down and another hour wasted on hold!!!!!
They\u2019re not fit for purpose. Get rid of them
"Oh, your receiving high call volumes at the moment, Gee, I wonder why ?  Anything to do with employing Cybermen, who all want to play 'Who Wants To Be A Millionaire', instead of actually helping the customers ?"

How can a new business survive these tricky times if we can't invoice our jobs??? Can anyone at HSBC actually help me with this?? Not just an answer phone telling me to press number after number to be told they won't discuss business accounts down the bloody phone!!!!!"

I\u2019ve not been able to get onto it since Friday? Every time I click on the app it shuts off!

Interesting advertisement. I have had many financial reviews with HSBC.  Pity their own Financial Advisors never mentioned HSBC would keep a chunk of my relatively small company pension for themselves when I reached State Pension age. I was a loyal employee for almost 40 years and I trusted them to do the right thing for me. I may have budgeted differently had I known.
HSBC seem to be offering fake help too. #bankingfraud #bankingscam

Disgusting never had such poor customer service 12 weeks to open an account now over 2hrs on hold to sort out something simple
"Ah, so those uber creepy HSBC billboards make perfect sense following the leak confirming it's links to the CCP. It's touching that fraud is a serious concern to HSBC but strange that ideological subversion isn't. Better red than dead, right? Choose life, folks. Choose Barclays."
"HSBC hopeless in every way, internet banking is useless, slow and outdated. Phone support takes an age. Local branches have been closed and the queues for other branches are horrendous. I will be closing all accounts both business and personal shortly. After 50 years as a customer I have never felt the need to move my banking as badly as i do right now. Impossible"
"I had a text the other day claiming to be from hsbc fraud . Asking me to follow the link to stop a payment , lucky I done some research and it was a scam .. be careful "
"So on the 13-10-2020 i applied for a Business bank account (after being made redundant). After numerous telephone calls spending hours on the phone, mostly on hold im informed that im  unable to open a business account 21-10-2020. Ive been a customer for 20 years. The email suggested that a credit check was undertaken for borrowing !!! I do not wish to borrow any money or require any funding. Im now self employed new business and busy working unable to sped hours on hold waiting for answers being put through to this department that department. Ive tried the appeal on line form and it continually times out. I require an account so that my clients can pay me. Totally disgusted with the whole process. I tried to book an appointment with a local bank shut on Saturdays and 4pm in the week (i have to work). I spoke to a guy in business this morning and he tells me the application has been closed. Extremely annoyed. HSBC please contact me regarding opening an account to place funds into ASAP."
"I opened new premier account only 2 months ago and what should of been simple task and enjoyable day paying for my new car ended up resulting in whole day on the phone 4 times each time holding for 30 minutes at least  each time, absolute disgrace im moving my bank account the service was just not good enough you did not do as you promised and I had to chase you to do what you promised. #moststreasfulbankingexperience"
My business banking account was opened in August 2020. To date have not received my online and telephone banking details and debit card. So really no point of opening an account with your guys at all! I have made serval attempts to contact you and waited for over an hour to speak with someone but to no avail! How and who can I contact to get an update (it's 4 months now!-unacceptable service) to know if at all the above mentioned have been sent out and/or where!!!!
HSBC suddenly switches to 'right on' black rights when it suits there marketing strategy..... YUK
Good
"Shame on you HSBC: https://www.change.org/p/hsbc-global-petition-immediate-unfreeze-the-hsbc-accounts-of-gnnd-church-\u8981\u6c42\u6ed9\u8c50\u7acb\u5373\u89e3\u51cd\u597d\u9130\u820d\u5317\u5340\u6559\u6703\u4e4b\u9280\u884c\u6236\u53e3?utm_source=share_petition&utm_medium=custom_url&recruited_by_id=3d7a3950-38ad-11eb-bc3f-c77c57bba008\n\n\u3010Global Petition: Immediate Unfreeze the HSBC accounts of Good Neighbour North District Church\u3011\nNot only the sole account of the church (with the unsuccessful experience of setting bank accounts at other non-China funded banks in HK) was found frozen today (7 December) without any prior notification nor justification provided, but also the accounts of the Church pastor, Mr. Chan Hoi Hing Roy, and his wife have been allegedly frozen.\n\nIn 2016, our church became a registered charity (IR No.: 91/14411). All the fund raised are legal donations from parties who wish to support our actions on serving the needy including those who are being ignored.\n\nSince the establishment of our church, we have been engaging in various community services for grassroots to act out Jesus\u2019s love. Our Hostel for Homeless started in 2014, which has provided 30 free hostel places in North Districts, Yuen Long and Kwun Tong to serve more than 70 cases with the assistance of social workers. During the pandemic of COVID-19, Social Welfare Department has approached our church several times, aiming to look for accommodation for the homeless. Freezing the church account would lead to immediate termination of the hostel service, inevitably forcing the homeless to be homeless again.\n\nThis is no doubt an act of political retaliation. In the past year, our group \u201cSafeguard Our Generation\u201d mainly comprised of middle-aged and elderly volunteers was determined to offer humanitarian aid to protestors at the frontline. Gracefully, most Hongkongers could see that Jesus is present by how we love each other, showing faith and care in the unprecedent social movement, while we, together with the widely respected paramedics and truth-seeking journalists, were ridiculously considered by the regime as opposition to the government. The purge has never ceased, just like the rasset freezing case of the self-exiled Democrats, Mr. Ted Hui and his family. Such incident has severely eradicated dissent in Hong Kong, suppressing freedom among religions and community service workers.\n\nWe are now urging HSBC to unfreeze the relevant accounts and to provide justification on freezing the accounts earlier. HSBC is undoubtedly exploiting the well-established independent financial system and sabotaging the benefits of individuals and groups of Hong Kong, as well as foreign investors within the territory. Hongkongers will demonstrate their determination in saying \u201cNO\u201d to injustice with what they own in hand."
It\u2019s good to see encouraging children..... but in terms of opening account or for a loan they can\u2019t be granted so easily as adults 
"HSBC please can you explain why you never call back your customers when they are promised a callback, this has been the case on four separate occasions now. An account my husband applied for in October and was approved soon after isn\u2019t open yet. Despite 8 phone calls and over 10 hours on the phone to you. "
"I have Facebook messaged, tweeted, visited the branch, downloaded the app, initialised telephone banking and rang three times a week and STILL haven't got a response from your mortgage team. I don't know what more I can do apart from fire myself from a cannon into your HQ shouting 'help'.\nThe app wont allow me to login any more as I never receive the text validation code. You're meant to be the worlds largest bank and the customer service is non existent!\nWhat do you advise I do??  "
I think HSBC are well versed and can give good advice with regards to fraud operations. Just listen to today's news about money laundering. The bank have been down this road before!
"Iv heard nothing about my top up yet, applied on the 10th of November!"
1 hour and 50 minutes ive been on hold. Mybe you should get you lighting team on the phones.
Great Bank
"Just had a 'safeguarding' call with HSBC, as I am trustee of a trust due to my son being disabled and unable to manage money. They last checked this account just 10 months ago. Apparently, there was a suspicious payment to 'SA Glasgow' which they wanted to investigate in regard to potential money laundering. I had to inform this idiot that 'SA Glasgow' is in fact 'HMRC Self Assessment', who are in Glasgow. It is Her Majesty's government, for goodness sake. This is just laughably incompetent. So instead of presenting yourself, HSBC, as caring citizens supporting Children in Need, how about ceasing to harass and intimidate people trying to support their disabled relatives for no reason whatsoever. "
"I support a community group who have been trying to get their account verified  - local branch staff in Doncaster are useless, online chat are useless, phoning for hours at a time and not getting anywhere.  The group are missing out on \xa31000's of funding, they were affected by the floods in Doncaster in 2019 and are still trying to build their community, money from funding pots will go a long way to help but they cannot apply because they haven't got their account sorted!!!!"
Can't get on my online account because the security pad is not responding. Do they sometimes need replacing?
"HSBC my wife tried to log on to business banking as usual on Sunday but it was immediately rejected saying that there were too many failed attempts. She followed the process including printing a form, completing it, taking a photo and uploading it. She has not heard from you. So this afternoon she called the main HSBC number for help. After 60 minutes of being on hold she ended the call. She then called the number that was on the form, despite being continually informed that she was in a priority queue, after 90 minutes of being on hold, she ended the call. That is two and half hours of lost time. We have never experienced such a poor service from any organisation before. What do you suggest?"
Shockingly poor customer service - I will be requesting a refund of my latest charges based on the 59 minute hold today which extended pat 5.30 and therefore was NEVER answered. HSBC Business FAIL.

Calling you since July to solve my online security settings...and still not working. It's a joke. Definitely changing this bank asap
Laughable that a greed driven bank like yours gives two hoots about homeless people. Money over everything
Day by day HSBC \U0001f1ec\U0001f1e7 service is getting down & closing of branches particularly in villages areas which is not a good sign of  the \u201cWorld's local bank\u201d.
"Does all rather sound like hollow words to me at the mo. My partner and I both work in Intensive Care and need a loan- after over two hours on the phone the best loan rate we could get was 12.9%. Having an excellent credit rating and being with the bank since a Griffin Saver in the 80\u2019s mean nothing to HSBC so it seems, key worker or no. Utterly let down by my bank in our hour of need. Im appalled. "
I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019ll ever answer the phone 
"All sorted now, thanks to Kasif, at least someone knows what their doing"
"Deal on with my case!!. Been over a month now. \nHaving the decency to get back to me would be appreciated.\n\nAdvice to anyone reading this and looking to use hsbc, take your busisness elsewhere!."

"This is the third credit check HSBC has done on my current account, with  regards to opening my business bank account, never had so many credit checks done on me, left a mark in my credit history you bet they have. This has been going on for 19 weeks, it will be 20 weeks this week. Promise after promise \u201cit\u2019s at quality control, so should be open this week never week at the latest\u201d lies and more lies. Two hours a day I spend on the phone every day getting this sorted, when I should be running my business, to get nothing and the guy today wasn\u2019t even trying to be nice. Bet I get a generic reply to this, because they can\u2019t even face the people they are letting down."
Awful bank. Only helpful when putting.money in!!!!taking it out they are totally deaf and u nhelpful.
This bank is getting worse you's keep blaming covid19 for someone to answer your phones been like this before covid19 then you say to use online banking thats rubbish too you get locked out all the time
"I wish you were the bank that helped people register power of attorney. We don't take one out for fun! We do it because a a family member is desperately ill. Don't make it any harder for us than it already is. I could probably open a bank account elsewhere quicker than the time it takes Ben Youde, Barry branch manager, to open his emails."
Improvement on your app would be nice. Its shocking.
Absolutely disgusting customer service from these charlatans!!! Trying to pay off a credit card to close the account and they want people to go into the branch in the middle of a pandemic as they will not take the payment over the phone !! And all the while milking what little interest they can...: ombudsman will love this 
"I like good old-fashioned cash but having been shielding for 6 months haven't had a chance to spend any.  I summoned up all my courage today to go into the bank to pay some into my account and swap the rest for new notes as I have no idea how long we will be shut in for.  The Welsh Dragon behind the counter refused point blank to swap them out, told me to spend it or pay it into my account!  DON'T TELL ME WHAT TO DO WITH MY MONEY!!\U0001f92c I had already paid in the bulk but wanted to keep some in the house for emergencies.  Why did they refuse to take them?"

"My husband, with my help, sent a PM yesterday.\nDespite being assured that it didn\u2019t apply to my husband\u2019s Flexsaver account, HSBC have cancelled his debit card, as they have on all savings accounts.\nHis pension and disability benefit both go into this account, his only one, and there\u2019s no way he can get money out of it. It\u2019s our only source of income. He can\u2019t even transfer money to my account.\nHe managed to contact someone through Live Chat two weeks ago, after receiving an email from HSBC re: the discontinuation of debit cards. He then realised that, months ago, he had been given the wrong info about his Flexsaver account. \nThe HSBC representative he \u2018chatted\u2019 with, suggested he apply to open a basic current account. He assured him that it would be a formality.\nMy husband called the number he gave us but, like so many others, he just couldn\u2019t get through, so he applied online.\nTwo weeks later, he\u2019s heard nothing from HSBC and, as of yesterday, we can\u2019t access any money at all for bills, pay-as-you-go gas and electricity, or even food.\nHSBC obviously aren\u2019t responding to any of these Facebook posts or PMs, so I\u2019m asking you all please, if this has happened to anyone else, have you managed to sort it, and how? - or have you any suggestions?\nThank you."
Well done Neil!! Awesome challenge and so many children helped \U0001f600
"HSBC HAS LITERALLY STOLEN MY MONEY. I opened an account, deposited tens of thousands and almost immediately after the account has been recommended for closure for no reason for over a month in which time my funds have been held and they refuse to release them to me. This cannot be legal. It is outrageous and I will be taking legal action. DO NOT USE THIS BANK!"
Emily Morrison remember when it happened to you too 
"13 weeks waiting for BBL. chasing them almost daily for weeks,  even our bank manager can't make any progress.  If they stopped putting resources into stupid Facebook  posts,  and used them to give a modicum of more than zero customer service,  that might help.  Useless bank."
"Thought I had budgeted until HSBC unfairly discriminated against me for starting my career in a particular time frame.  Shame on you Midland Bank /HSBC - only 50% of pension for the lowest paid staff, 30% clawed back by the bank and 20% tax. Doesn't apply to the highest paid though. What a surprise. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk for details and case studies."
HSBC you should be ashamed of yourselves! We were all told what a brilliant pension we were agoing to get. But in reality it was all a sham! You were actually going to use the state pension to subsidise your own scheme! ie clawback the equivalent of the state pension from your hard working ex staff when they reach state pension age! Mainly effecting the lowest paid and predominantly women. Shame on you!
I\u2019m with you.  I\u2019ve had an account for 40 years.  Need to make an important payment.  Have spent hours on the phone today - speaking to over 5 members of staff - line gone dead twice.  For no reason they\u2019ve decided that they don\u2019t trust the payee despite my assurances that I have triple checked the details.  Now suspended access to my bank account.  Now saying that can\u2019t make the payment until I\u2019ve gone into a branch and proved my identity.  No branches open this weekend.  HSBC won\u2019t let me use my account and jeopardising my future for no reason at all.  Have put in a complaint but won\u2019t be actioned in time.  Disgraceful treatment of a long standing customer.  I\u2019m astonished that they would do this.
Appalling customer services. I have now been on hold for 3 hours on 3 different occasions in one day and still no response
"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.\nWithin 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - \xa34000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!\nHSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.\nOntop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.\nHSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.\nI HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
"Well it doesn't help when you won't let me log on app because of up grade  and I can't get new one ,so I am stuck. Back to telephone banking now is NOT a good time to fix something that's not broken"

will be closing my account soon . on phone for ages then sent me messages saying it was going to get sorted 2 weeks later still not done what they said. so messaged again message back was i will sort this week gone passed still np joy. messaged again yesterday said they would get back to me still waiting. will never recomend this bank to anybody.

I would love to donate again this year to Children in Need. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word.

"Four times I phoned your dispute team on Monday 1st time waited 50 minutes, 2nd 20 minutes then another 50 minutes finally was answered only to be told that it was not the dispute department even though that was the number they asked me to phone. Young lady tried to help then put me on hold for the dispute department after a hour and 15 minutes gave up. \nGot through yesterday was answered in 50 minutes went through my dispute sent paperwork while on phone and was told they would phone be back today(was on phone just over an hour). Phoned me back today told she couldn\u2019t help me put me on hold for dispute team after over an hour come back and told me to phone another number have asked them to phone me back but not expecting them to just want my money back never mind giving new customers \xa3125 this customer will be moving on after 34 years with HSBC."
HSBC your customer service is an absolute shambles. I have been waiting over 10 weeks for a response and still nothing. What a joke
"HSBC   \nYou did this to my Son.  Here is his letter to you.  \n\nDear HSBC, I am going to bank these cheques you have sent to buy my kids Christmas presents. \nHowever do not take this as my acceptance of your negligence when you were supposed to be dealing with this over 7 years ago.\nBack then I was,\nILL (just had a mild stroke)\nWas made redundant.\nLiving on a shoe string,\nLost my car, nearly lost my house. I ended up renting out my house and living with my mom in Devon and what did you do absolutely nothing and in fact you did worse you shut down all my accounts because I was awarded the PPI you had denied owing me after 2/3 years of fighting you. \nDo you no what it is like having bailiffs knocking at your door for something that wasn't your fault. \nThen 7 years later now I'm back on my feet you send me this guilt letter. \nHow about you go into my credit file and readjust everything that you did and give me back 3 years of my life. Your bank disgusts me ."
Been on the phone almost 4 hours to report fraud! Can\u2019t believe no one has answered! I will be changing all my accounts to Halifax! At least they answer urgent calls! \U0001f621 
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n\nHSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n\nTIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!"
HSBC i have been on the phone for 3 hours today and 2 hours yesterday! i have an issue i am trying to sort out and i have been moved from department to department my phone bill is going be huge as i have spent over 4 hours on the phone and not a single step closer to resolving the issue
HSBC terrible service. No one answering no email to leave a message. Just no concern for customers but will no doubt chase as soon as I fail to make a payment. All i want is a mortgage settlement figure. The sooner I get it the sooner I can leave. Just awful
"HSBC - your having a laugh aren\u2019t you. My parents, in their late 70s, have recently been a victim of fraud, having thousands that they cannot afford taken out of their account. They went to a branch, only to be told they would have to call. They have called 3 times this week, spent a total of 8 hours on the phone, only to be cut off each time. I\u2019m assuming you clearly don\u2019t care about your customers, even if they are elderly and vulnerable "
Worst customer service ever .\n 90 minutes waiting still no answer. \nAnd some staff even advised me to take my business account to another bank as hsbc seem to be going backwards no forward .\nI have a payment needing to go through tonight not much chance now
"Good advertising, but just not true! You're being the most unhelpful bank I've ever known. 24th June I notified you of POA for my mother. That took roughly 3 months to get through your legal department. I now need help setting up online banking on my laptop. The instructions on your website don't quite match your printed information. I called today and after a while was transferred to someone who said they could help. He went away to log into online banking then cut me off! I'm wanting online banking to save me queuing outside my local branch for half an hour in this weather, then spending half an hour getting transactions through, keeping other customers waiting! Seems you've furloughed too many staff and now can't cope with the work required to operate a bank, or any business, efficiently. We are paying for this in every way. Is there any chance of getting some help, real help?"
Go away HSBC/. Just concentrate on running a legitimate business first instead of these surface pr soundbites....
"How about making some updates to your UK staff pensions.  52,000 suffering outdated, unfair and immoral clawback. Some of the lowest paid staff now having 30% of their already small pension taken back, although you look after the senior managers by only taking back 2% from their high pensions! Time to do the right thing HSBC. Ian Stuart, Noel Quinn take a good look at your group standards and then try applying them to your older and longer serving staff and pensioners. Remove clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"
Love this Chima
Great work Chima!
"Been to the local HSBC to change a Scottish 20 pound note, and been told they cannot do it, bloody useless."
When's white history month???
I applied for BBL in May. Phoned over and over again Apparently it\u2019s all ok but nothing ever happens 
Brilliant .... well done Kwabena and Mark. 
How about making some improvements to your helpline. Would be nice to be able to speak to someone!!
"Maybe put your call centres in the UK. I never used to believe the bloke I was talking to was really called \u201cMichael\u201d when he had such a shocking level of English. \nHowever, that aside HSBC wrote off a debt to them due to my disability and acted really really kindly and nicely with empathy and compassion, so I am impressed with them. "
On hold for almost an hour (so far) my mortgage term ended 31st Aug and my new company have been chasing you for final documents for almost 2 weeks?!?!?! What's the hold up!!!!
Worst service: two staff members that don\u2019t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n
"Taking of Fairer tales. How about the one concerning a female branch clerk who has given 40 years of her life to the bank, some part-time and some full-time, who retires on a pension of \xa315k a year, only to find the bank claw back 30% of that when she hits State Pension Age - compared to a senior male manager who retires on \xa3150k a year but inly has 2% a year clawed back from his huge pension. HSBC claim that is fair and equitable! See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"
"Its not their money so how are they expected to care, i made a purchase from a scam company where they asked only for the postage on the sample, in the same transaction that company took \xa3163 membership (not agreed)charge. HSBC no help at all."
i have been on hold for 1hr 45 mins and need to speak to somebody
Absolutely Amazing Neil. Fantastic achievement. Helping so many. You are truly inspirational and very good & lovely human being \U0001f44f\U0001f44f\U0001f44f
"Together against fraud? HSBC allows it and then does nothing to rectify it! I will be moving my accounts when all of this is resolved, that\u2019s if it ever is! "
"You can light up buildings and honour all sorts of groups, other than your own staff pensioners. Some State Pension Integration might be fair but your clawback isn't. Take back only 2% from the highest paid but 30% from the lowest! Typical greed from the senior management. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"
How about answering your phones so I can get my on line banking back your fraud team need to answer more calls
"No they are not, 45 mins and I still can\u2019t get through !!!! 2 weeks now Iv been trying to get through to the business disputes team. Asked for callback never got one. Iv filled a form in heard nothing. Everytime Iv called Iv been waiting an hour to get through this is not just today it has been everyday for past 2 weeks. It\u2019s not acceptable will someone call me back"
could not agree more - useless effers can't even answer the phone 53 minutes and waiting. Absolutely unacceptable 
How many countries you armed this year HSBC? \n\nHOW IS YOUR WEAPON DISTRUBUTION GOING? \n\nEVIL COMPANY
"I work for a homeless charity. We struggle with obtaining bank accounts for clients. Is it possible to have some more information, an email address would be brilliant as I have tried to call with not any success thank you"
Ashleigh \U0001f60a
"HSBC is one of the worst bank in the UK. I have a business account with you, there was a fraud transaction on my account, the card was blocked and call back was promised on weekend. No one called me yet. I keep calling the bank since yesterday morning, I am on the phone for 50+ minutes but no asnwer. It is absolutely unacceptable. Your customer service is huge zero. \U0001f621"
"What a joke you don\u2019t care to understand. 2 hours every day Monday to Friday for the last 2 spent in the phone chasing round departments, trying to open a business account, which has been in processing for the over 19 weeks. Promised it will be open next week, week after week, the stress of this has taken it physical toll on me. You want to understand better don\u2019t and talk to people more face to face, and treat people the way you would want to be treated!"
"Your telephone online phone services are absolutely diabolical , I am on hold waiting for you automated service to give me telephone banking details for my childs account, i started this call before 1 pm , spent ages talking to one of your representatives who kept putting me on hold and asking my son for his details time and time again.  Finally managed to get her to understand what we wanted and she has put us on hold for this automated line (30 munutes ago), what I orginally asked for was for my son and my daughters internet telephone banking number and digital passkeys to be be posted to us at the address you have registered.  They cannot be emailed as when we opened the account you managed to get my email address wrong.    and now to add insult to injury after two hours and five minures we have we have been cut off absolutely furious "
As of today no one has answered the emails i sent from my account before Xmas. There is not an option to view sent messages to check on which particular day. When will i expect someone to get back to me?
"I was calling from abroad more than 25 minutes and didn\u2019t receive an answer. The worst service ever I\u2019ve had. Also they sent message to DM that they operating Saturday and Sunday. Actually, they don\u2019t"
"I have tried to call twice reference suspicious activity on my mortgage account; on hold for over 30 minutes on the last call without answer. It's an absolute joke. I run a call centre for a prestigious car company. If I treated my customers like you do, I would expect to be fired."
"Deal on with my case!!. Been over a month now. \nHaving the decency to get back to me would be appreciated.\n\nAdvice to anyone reading this and looking to use hsbc, take your busisness elsewhere!."
Over an hour waiting to sort out a duplicate payment disgusting you can reverse it yet you have people saying they can't when can be done that's my money I can't access
Shocking waiting times
"HSBC I tell you what we are tired of, the bank trying to portray itself as the best at this, the best at that, and still ripping off it's pensioners by taking part of their state pension.  You say it was ""part of the scheme and clearly communicated"". Hogwash !!  Many ex staff won't get a full state pension anyway because you contracted us all out but conveniently forgot to say that means you will get a reduced state pension.  The only thing you are best at is dumping on your staff from a great height, you'd win awards for that."
"Also be wary of HSBC scams... Just had this txt through.... Yet I've never been with HSBC .....\n\nHSBC: A payment was attempted from a new device. If this was NOT YOU, please visit: https://hs-payeevalidate-security-support.com/"
No reply to my complaint ombudsman here I come 
Chima an inspiration to all.
Glad you\u2019re focused on fraud\nHope that means you\u2019ll stop pretending your business customers have a telephone banking service where somebody will actually answer the phone \U0001f921\U0001f921\U0001f921
"Why no email address to contact you?  Particularly when you give advice like ""Following the government's guidance for people to only leave their home for essential travel, we're taking every step possible to protect our customers and colleagues during this time.\n\nAs a result, we'll no longer be able to receive post into our Commercial Centres. We ask instead, that you contact us via email, with scanned documents where applicable. Please email us from your work email address that we hold on file for your business, rather than your personal email address."
May I suggest that until you can operate your business contact center properly (or at all) you concentrate on the core business in hand.....................

"You talk about dreams but you are destroying mine.. Im heartbroken that you've undervalued my flat by 20,000. I adopted a dog who's owner is now too ill too take him back and I've fallen in love with him but I can't keep him in my flat so I was buying a house which has now fallen through because you have undervalued my flat so much. Please help me and reconsider HSBC"
Absolutely horrendous customer service if actually get a fraudulent activity on your account. No assistance had to request putting my new own account on hold as customer services wouldn\u2019t do anything to help until the money came out (transaction pending) in the meantime I should leave my account accessible??!! Now trying to discuss further with the fraud team and been on hold over 2 hours and counting. Absolutely disgusting 
Didn't Mr Sunak give away billions to scammers?
This type of service is now happening everywhere!!!  I feel your pain!!!   Hope you guys are good.   If you need anything just ask \U0001f44d\U0001f3fc
Da iawn chi \U0001f44f\U0001f44f
"HSBC customer service is quite frankly disgusting at the moment. Organisations have had 7 months to put measures in place and yet still appallingly slow service is being blamed on COVID-19. Last week took 6 attempts to obtain a redemption statement, by the time it was finally sent the expiry date meant not enough time to complete on a new mortgage so back to square one. New one requested on 24th, here we are 6 days later and still no sign of it. Not good enough."
"Despite being a multi billion pound profit making organisation, they are still hiding behind Covid 19 as a reason for shocking service. The pandemic happened over 9 months ago - this is the new nom - sort it out!!"
"Been on hold for SIX hours and then cut off, fabulous customer service. Branch can\u2019t help me either...."
Getting your online site to load is always a challenge in itself.
"I received a text tonight from HSBC fraud alert, I contacted the fraud department and spoke to a lady who has cancelled my card but as a fraudulent transaction has already been made I needed to speak to another department I eventually got through to this department and the lady asked me my name so I gave her my name and she asked me to repeat it so I did and then she said she couldn\u2019t deal with me and that I need to go into the branch. Absolutely disgraceful service from HSBC"
"I've just been defrauded today for the second time in recent history and now find myself in a position where I am classed as vulnerable and have to go into branch to verify myself again, which I went through in late November. This is before you will even consider taking any action to resolve the fraud. Getting very tired of this now. I will be visiting another bank after my visit to branch tomorrow so I can move my money to somewhere much safer."
Very nice of you to care so much. What a shame your customer service is so useless. Always passing the buck and always refering you back to the telephone rather than on line chat. Disgusting attitude to genuine concerns. Still waiting for a letter sent 3 weeks ago and reminded you but STILL no letter or answer fro. Customer. care. You have even paid money into my account yet wont tell me why it break down the details. So  So shoddy and uncaring
"That\u2019s a great job \U0001f490 done by HSBC, hope other local banks can come forward \U0001f691 like this and help the nation. "
Is it true you will close someone's account if they refuse to wear a mask ?
Couldn't care less about small businesses unless they're in debt. Hugely in the black so not worth bothering about. Let down and ignored for 15 years - it all ends here!
How do I contact you about BBL application update please
"I've just been through my call records. just over 8 Hours I have been on the phone for in total for the same issue, majority has been on hold, the rest is being told to call another department. It seems to always be a different department you need, guess what, join another queue!"
Business banking is bloody terrible. Cant pay staff or suppliers as I cant access my online banking..... spoken to them 5 times in last 1.5 days and still not resolved.\nCall centre will cut you off if approaching end of their shift after holding for an hour and twenty minutes
Hi HSBC when you apply online for a mortgage holiday extension do you receive some sort of email confirming receipt of your application? I\u2019m only asking as I\u2019ve received nothing and wanted to make sure that my application has been received.
HSBC are threatening to close bank accounts if you do not wear a mask. This will soon change to if you havent been vaccinated be under no doubt. If you have an account with HSBC I would suggest you cancel it now. This kind of totalitarian behaviour is not acceptable.
"They are not laws but guidelines, I will close  my family account and my business account first thing next week. "
Watch out
"Pointless having the Sleaford branch when all u get told is we can\u2019t deal with anything face to face use internet/telephone banking. Just close the branch then, it\u2019s on part time hours n skeleton staff anyway"
Go Okechukwu Chima!! 
I applied to HSBC bounceback loan in july. I got a conformation email and since have had nothing.  I have spent 7 hours in total listening to the mind warping music on hold and have not spoken to anyone and  have a business account with HSBC. Shocking!
"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"
"HSBC just FYI, received this text with a link....it\u2019s not me, and I don\u2019t have an HSBC account. Not going to click on the link! The phone number it came from is at the top of the text.

"When will the GSA system error for mobile and desktop be fixed? I can't activate my new secure key and access my bank, at all. This follows two weeks of not being able to get into my bank following that faulty mobile app update. So after three weeks of IT issues at HSBC, I would like an explanation and update on when I can access my bank"
"Your business needs to be regulated.  You are also a f up mess with Safeguard, it is one of the most stressful things anyone can go through with your bank.  We have moved our entire banking to Starling bank.  Had enough of you HSBC, we will also refuse to pay back the Government backed loan, that is your problem, we refuse to give you any of that back due to the stress and chaos of dealing with your business.  So thank you for the free Government backed loan, that is now your proble. Perhaps instead of dictating to your customers with your terribly executed Safeguard, perhaps you might want to work on making your services more user-friendly.  Also can you please stop blaming Covid for you not answering your phones.  You have always been slow with answering your phones, so why the lies?.  You are a terrible bank, a relic of a past that is going to catch up with you soon.  "

I opened an account, deposited tens of thousands and almost immediately after the account was recommended for closure for no reason for over a month in which time my funds have been held and they refuse to release them to me. This cannot be legal. It is outrageous and I will be taking legal action. DO NOT USE THIS BANK!"
I LOVE HOW I GET TOLD THAT I WILL GET CALL BACKS FROM COMPLAINTS/DISPUTES TEAMS AND NEVER DO!!
I\u2019m still on hold since 9am this morning listening to the HSBC music\U0001f937\u200d\u2642\ufe0f
Most ridiculous system! Hubby been trying for over two hours to get through to fraud
WHY HAVE U PUT MY BANK ACC UNDER REVIEW???? 
I have been a victim of a scam and fraud and HSBC have told me I have to wait ten weeks before I may get my money back!!! This is ludicrous. I'm in my first year of trading as a sole trader and banks are supposed to help you. Instead I'm being punished for working hard. Definitely not leaving my money in my HSBC account again. Learn from your mistakes.
Call wait times are horrendous! Was on hold for over an hour today before giving up. Live chat has disappeared and my local branch is closed due to covid restrictions!
"Thanks for the heads up and, please, tell your excellent support line staff, that we hope they and their families are safe."
Worst service: two staff members that don\u2019t have a clue about how to find a solution to a problem:\n\nStaff ID numbers 45014422 and 43899840 \n
Price gouging people during a pandemic. Utterly diabolical behaviour. Just been told my new rate if I want a loan is 22% where before the pandemic when I took out a similar loan it was 5%
"I haven\u2019t been able to get on to the app for several days now, keep getting an error message.

Absolutely disgusted withHSBC  \nMy parents have banked with you for years! They went into their local branch for some help and advice only to be told there was on one who could help them! Than went back to try and sort out online banking only to be told to go home and do it them selves. Their both in their 70s and are in no way stupid but they are old fashioned and wanted face to face help. To set up online banking you need a telephone security code which they don\u2019t have and we\u2019re not told they needed in branch. When my dad mentioned about moving banks the assistant just said good luck with that!!\nYou have all these adverts saying how your there to help in different ways to suit customers needs !!!

Update from HSBC after calling again after waiting over the 5 days they said it would take to be asked all the same questions to then be told the application has been Cancelled and to apply again (3rd time) due to no documentation being provided. I asked which documentation she could tell me. Asked to complain she couldn\u2019t escalate it any further. Honestly what an utter pile of crap bank! I will be transferring all my accounts from you to another bank who will appreciate my custom!!!
"Well, I was going to complain about your telephone banking system, but it seems many many others have beaten me to it....no wonder your ""experiencing a high number of calls""...all I would like is someone to call me back so I don't have to spend another hour getting through, only to be cut off by the HSBC staff I ended up talking to."
"Hi HSBC, I've sent you a message but not heard back - is anyone actually checking your messages?"
"Complaint \nHi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it\u2019s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar"
I downloaded the new app and been asked for a 6 letter password I haven't set up... tried 3 times today to sort out with your call centre and on hold over 40 mins each time... why I downloads the app is beyond me should have stuck with my key

Don't look the other way with BAD SERVICE. I won't accept this sort of BAD SERVICE on behalf of my elderly father"
Well done
i do not like the new ladies voice on the phone she isnt as clear as the old one 
Why are all branches near me only open 10 til 2 Monday to friday?? Not helpful for the 9-5 workers really!
"I totally agree and have had there same negative experience near 3 hours on 3 occasions trying to get to a customer service agent and then they give you the wrong answer, you know its wrong, yet they insist there is no other way!! total frustration they just put me into an impossible on line loop! I've closed my small business account.  It is incompetence, maybe not deliberate, but the on-line support it very poor."
Merry Christmas!!!
"We recently changed our business address (on the phone) and I specifically asked whether HSBC had all of the information needed - and said that no other details had changed.

Answer the phone you bunch of mongs!! Absolute dire customer service as always
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. \n\nThis has now left me with no other option than to contact:\n1: The financial ombudsman \n2. BBC Watchdog\n3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.\n\nIt's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! \n\nIf you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. \n\nAbsolutely appalling service.\n"
"Anyone actually working today?  I've been on holday for 90 minutes trying to get a fraud dispute resolved from April, not only have you still not replied, this is the second time I've been on hold for over an hour and a half repeatedly being told ""my call is being held in a queue and will be answered shortly!"" Lies, lies and more lies!  I even raised a complaint several weeks ago and you haven't responded to that either.  Poor customer service is an understatement!"
Getting worse. No app and no phone

TG I got a pre lockdown appointment with Barclays son can close my accounts with HSBC...and open new one....HSBC fraud department admits they have made a mistake but only the dispute department can reverse the transaction...but they cant get hold of them....I have spent 5 hours on hold waiting for despute team to answer....they dont because they dont exist....

"I wish to complain that there should be a method that works to communicate with HSBC. If one method does not work then another should be available even if it takes a while to reply. At the moment it seems no method is available for me to communicate after logging on which is not good enough. Also the chatline should answer the questions I actually ask. If not, then they need education in English!"
"Online chat, I messaged 3 weeks ago and keep getting a reply saying you can\u2019t handle my enquiry at the moment!!! All I want to do is open a simple savings account. Telephone banking keep saying due to COVID it\u2019s to much of a risk to open a savings account to staff!!!. Never heard so much rubbish in my life! Every time I apply online I get told I can\u2019t open one because I\u2019m under the age of 18!. I\u2019m 37!!! As my records will say on you\u2019re system!!."
"What a lousy Bank with NO customer service. As a new business customer I've never experienced such bad customer service. You can't get through on any telephone number, their online chat service can't answer any questions and as yet I haven't found and email address to contact them."
"Hey I can't access an account for a vulnerable person as her appointed POA, I never ever wanted to use HSBC but I have to respect the wishes of this customer, my HSBC card is actually issued in the wrong name even though I produced all my documents at a local branch 18 miles away.i refused to go back with the same documents as life is too short"
HSBC So are you closing accounts if they refuse to wear a mask? 
"So, I took over as Chair of a Community Group which have an account with HSBC in Feb. In September, believing the bank would by now be contact-able to sort out bank accounts. Over 90 minutes waiting for the phone to be answered, unclear forms to fill out and then a letter sent to the wrong address saying it was done wrong and to phone the original number. Now back waiting on the same phone number again just to get in contact with someone. Such bad service. Unless things are resolved, our organisation will be moving accounts - that is if we can actually get in touch with someone! So bad - avoid if you are a community group :-("
"Shame on you HSBC, I thought I had budgeted for my retirement, only to find out I was 'losing' \xa3125 a month from my small pension, I'm lucky enough to have a husband with a pension as I'm pretty sure I couldn't manage without him and our joint pensions, really feel for anyone on their own trying to manage. Shame on you HSBC!!!!!"
"2 1/2 hours on 6 calls today, first 4 waited over 20 mins to be answered then went dead, 5th call answered after 30 mins kept being put on hold then cut off after 45mins! Now waiting again! And I'm not even an HSBC customer! How do I stop you sending letters to a former resident of my address?"

Had a text today saying from HSBC that payment had been attempted from a new device and I should contact hs- security notification.com/login. I do not have an HSBC acc but handle my deceased brother's accounts which are frozen. Should I be concerned? I have not opened the link.

Ironic that HSBC warning people about scams when they scam customers of 30 years plus with rip off interest rates on personal borrowing despite current interest rates being their lowest ever. Rip off bank. 
have to say trying to get hold of your mortgage centre and have now been holding for over 40 minutes is totally unacceptable.

"HSBC Bloody useless bank! Ignore these supposedly positive posts,  I cannot understand how unresponsive they are,  don't deserve to be in business considering the way they treat,  or, rather ignore their customers.  Been waiting nearly 13 weeks for bounce back loan,  chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last almost  2 weeks, he's getting no-where, apparently.  Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it!  I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!"
Could someone tell the point of this feed if HSBC are not there for customers when they need them ? 
The service I have received from HSBC in India is appalling. No one takes ownership. No one cares patheic
Be overly suspicious. Block your customers transaction as fraudulent (it wasn\u2019t) and then hold the money in pending for days. Completely ignore the customer and hang up on them. Or simply just keep transferring and putting them customer on hold.\n\nMaybe if you think a transaction is fraudulent you could talk to the customer rather than leave it up to the customer to sort out themselves afterwards?

no its not available..i m on hold for 3 hours ( pathetic )
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking."
Can you please let us know when your smaller branches are back to normal hours. All other retail shops etc have re opened.
Worst bank ever \nthey locked my account with no reson  \neven though i prove the money from my account \nthey still didn't unlock it as a team which has no phone number has not answer to the 10 emails send to them \nthey left me with no money at all even though i told them that i have a family with 2 small kids which i need to take care of them \n

"Well HSBC are you really helping people and businesses out? I applied for my bounce back loan over 2 months ago, wrote multiple emails, spent hours on the phone and still nothing!

"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"

HSBC are threatening to close bank accounts if you do not wear a mask. This will soon change to if you havent been vaccinated be under no doubt. If you have an account with HSBC I would suggest you cancel it now. This kind of totalitarian behaviour is not acceptable.
"Shame that HSBCs customer service for its business customers is contemptible. As a business customer I am sick to the back teeth of being made to queue on the phone for hours to sort HSBC ISSUES and forced to speak to people who don\u2019t have English as their first languages, making the whole experience even more painful.

"I have been waiting since early June for BBL. I have been a customer for about twenty years. I have phoned, emailed, messaged and escalated a complaint twice and NOBODY has ever got back to me. The second other banks are back to normal I will be taking all six of my wife\u2019s and my bank accounts elsewhere. I have already penned a letter to the ombudsman. Just going to send it now"
Worst customer service ever .... I have been waiting 46 days to get back money from a cash machine that did not dispense ... all you get is fobbed off with ' we are looking at the issue ' really is this the best you can do 
Glad I'm not the only one. Need a settlement figure 90 mins yesterday over an hour today. No email addresses. Very ver poor service HSBC. I appreciate less staff available but this is the worst service I have ever experienced
Hi - We really could do with your assistance please?  We applied for a government backed BBL with you around 3 weeks ago as our bank has stopped doing them (Tide).  We've completed all tasks required in the process but it would appear the HSBC Identify app on IOS is not uploading the documents as it's stating it has.  we've called your BBLS hotline and after being on hold for around 1hr 5 mins the line goes dead.  We've tried this process several times and it would appear the process has broken.  Could we go in to our local branch to speed this process up or can you call me please?
how come I can't register my commercial credit card and business debit card with apple pay ?
"Complaint \nHi ,WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it\u2019s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar"
Never had a problem with HSBC been wirh them since they were Midland Bank
"Today, HSBC have proven that they do NOT want to help people! After confirming over the phone that my mortgage would be accepted (I thought I better make sure in this current climate) HSBC have just informed me, 24 hours before my official mortgage meeting, that they can no longer offer the original mortgage. Due to the confirmation I went ahead and SOLD MY HOUSE! paid for solicitors fees! paid for surveys! to now be told, sorry, we changed it last month....did no one tell you?? You know I haven't been told (despite talking to TWO employees AFTER this date) because you log all the call info. After suggesting that this might be a bit s**t of them to do all of a sudden, I was told I can't speak to a manager, but they emailed a manager for me, for them to be told there's nothing they can do. Either give us more money, or you lose what you have already paid towards your house move, and you stay put. Makes no difference that this will be my third mortgage with HSBC and been a customer for 28 years. So yeah, great Tuesday so far!!"
"Use your app? I would love to,  but the latest update says my device is no longer compatible so can't use it. So I thought I know, online banking,  guess what I need a code and where do I get that from......the app.\U0001f928"
"Over 2 hours on hold so far to the fraud team to get my card unblocked, need to use my card today to order shopping"
"HSBC I am really annoyed ! Your customer services are not helping me. I have several refunds waiting to go back into my bank account from November from 3 different companies, all of which are saying the refunds have been completed their end ! I need urgent help as obviously there is something wrong as they\u2019re not coming into my bank account and nobody is willing to help me at your customer services !  HELP me urgent "
"Channel 4 News interviewing HSBC about the environment.  HSBC invests in tropical rainforest destruction.  And they talk about action, action, action.  Hypocrisy, hypocrisy, hypocrisy more like!!!!!"
The world's most useless bank 
How about anstweing your customer service line (on hold for more that 2 hours now.) Or communicating with business customers regarding bounce back loans - NOTHING other than an confirmation of application email 8WEEKS AGO!!!!!!!!!!!!.
Now officially the worst business bank and the most massive farce of an organisation - I'm off to the Co-op
Can somebody message me please It won\u2019t let me message you???
"I also bank with Lloyds, Nationwide and Santander - and I can honestly say HSBC is the SLOWEST and POOREST customer service. I have been waiting for a bounceback loan to come through for a very long time, no word, no email, no letters - totally unnacceptable. This is a government scheme and the bank should sort this out as a matter of priority. Why does it take 2 hours for someone to answer the phone, and when they do they don't know how to help?? The lockdown excuse is wearing thin now. Most people are back at work! Terrible."
The only scam around here is this bank\u2019s approach to bounce back loans. 
"This is good and nice. However HSBC do not have a great record in being fair and putting cash behind actions. Some 52,000 of their own staff pensioners are hit by pension clawback. All very well for the most senior managers, who only have c2% clawed back but the lowest paid staff, some on pensions well below \xa310k a year are having c30% clawed back. That is unfair, unequal and discriminatory. Time for HSBC to do the right thing and remove clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"
"Great little empty gesture in the face of the recent controversies eh? Stop laundering dirty money and abetting murderers, it kinda puts your pretty lights to shame there. Absolutely no effort at all "
HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out
"HSBC pretend to be good, but they do not care one sec for their customers. Simply no customer service to find at all"
"I moved  bank to metro Bank, opening branches, managers you can meet, 5 min wait time on the phone. \n\nWill never use HSBC again"
I have been waiting for business banking 47minutes and still on hold terrible service 
You were freezing my account because of all the fraud that was done on there and the lady at the bank said it would be put on hold and that I'd have to go into the bank to withdrawal money until my photo ID is sorted and I've just checked my online banking and 2 payments made online have come out. I was told my card would no longer be able to be used online.  All my money for my son's Xmas and birthday all gone!! I can't speak to anyone over the telephone because the automated service doesn't recognise my birthday and because that doesn't work no advisors will speak to me because I've failed security. Furious right now.
Hope all my colleagues there are ok x
Heres how to use it wisely. Bank with any bank.. anyone but HSBC
now up to eight hours in total waiting on the phone to get clearance for my new security fob. I havent been able to use my account properly in over a month. you couldnt make it up . I'm moving my account today. Enough is enough 
"If you are thinking of leaving your bank please don't go to TSB\n\nIts disgusting how TSB treats its customers during this time in the world. As a Business customer I'm not able to get online bank statements only paper copies which is extremely wasteful of paper and energy, this also means I am unable to provide the UK government bank Funding Circle the correct documents they need for my covid business interruption loan application as they only accept digital copies. What an absolute disgrace of a bank."
It would be nice if you could help the rest of the people too! Horrible service!!
If you had UK based customer service this wouldn't be a problem 
"We\u2019ve finally given up, had business accounts for 30 years with HSBC, as soon as other banks are open to new business accounts we\u2019re off, they\u2019ve been a disgrace for months now."
The details online say your open and when you go through all the rigmarole on phone \U0001f937\u200d\u2642\ufe0f. A message says this office is now closed !. Very poor service !. Also get diverted by your people to other departments after 30 mins of waiting to answer and then says closed . What a Shambles . You only seem to care about new custom !. Well I\u2019m a new customer to all the other banks out there . Sort you phone service and existing customer service or lose thousands of customers !

Price gouging people during a pandemic. Utterly diabolical behaviour. Just been told my new rate if I want a loan is 22% where before the pandemic when I took out a similar loan it was 5%

"WORSE Team of all times is HSBC Egypt , I regret dealing with you being a premier customer & suffering for 6 months to issue a Debit card , having loads of problems & errors due to chaotic below standards services & a management who is covering up the mistakes instead of trying to fix it ... I am unable to do a simple transaction or transfer from my account in Egypt to mine in UK ... it\u2019s simply a team of losers & great failure compared to HSBC UK or HSBC Qatar "
"HSBC just closed it\u2019s Birmingham Sheldon Branch in which I got the account.... HSBC needs to stop \u270b branch openings scams. Many business owners opened account due to new branches, but now they transferred it to to Solihull Branch which is far away from Sheldon."
"I have for 4 weeks now been trying to contact HSBC Business regarding a fraud issue in our business account, there is no email, no reply from the ""call back"" request, on line chat said they would get someone to call, FB messenger could not help (even to suggest how to contact them) the telephones are not answered................................."
"Fantastic service in westo -super-mare today. Lovely gentleman opening the door, chatting to my son whilat we waited and the lovely teresa ede who dis his withdrawal making it a fun experience all round for an 8 year old! Also a huge thank you to the lovely lady who helped us find his details. A great team :)"
You the bank have created a nightmare scenario and ONLY you my bank for many years can fix this error or you have left a single dad with zero local support no bank account and no way to shop while we are in isolation due to covid. \nYou closed my bank by error and I'm stuck at home and cant fix the problem.
It is a scam what HSBC is doing to their staff's pensions! #fightforfairness
"Deal on with my case!!. Been over a month now. \nHaving the decency to get back to me would be appreciated.\n\nAdvice to anyone reading this and looking to use hsbc, take your busisness elsewhere!."
I would love to donate again this year to Children in Need. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out
Are you actually joking. For the last few years  I have called HSBC and always have the long wait message. Maybe you should employ more advisors to handle the calls? Will be switching over to Metro bank soon as HSBC have been nothing but a let down recently.

"HSBC currently due to lockdown to wait and reach the operators from abroad is expensive. So, it would be beneficial if we can arrange a direct call with the operator and then catch up. Otherwise to wait 15-20 minutes is impossible by international calls."

"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"
"Sort your system out, thousand of Boyce back application dropped from your system and without fixing just saying sorry to your customers. What a joke"

"I applied for a business bank account in July. I completed every form and supplied every detail as required. I have not had any communication from you, despite messaging, emailing and phoning. As a small business, trying to survive under difficult conditions, your lack of consideration is appalling. I hope people remember how you mistreated them when life eventually goes back to normal."
Locked out of internet banking and the only way to unlock it is to call you on a number that is incredibly busy! Move with the times and have more options. 
So Whats new.  Customer service is non existent already.
"Your bank is an absolute joke.  How the hell do you expect older people to make contact.  No local branch, refusal to issue the local branches' telephone number so that a conversation can be had, telephone line manned by people that my parents really can't understand.   All of this in the middle of a pandemic when they have been told to shield and not visit banks.  All we want to do is speak to the local manager and it is impossible.  Time to move all three bank accounts that have been with HSBC/Midland Bank for 30 plus years."

"Gave up on the phone yesterday after waiting over 2 hours and still on hold!!

Also sent a direct messsage on FB yesterday that hasn't even been looked at. Anyone would think your company has collapsed with this non existant service!! I'm reporting these cases to the FCA this afternoon infoming them of your failure to comply to your code of practice in regards to customer complaints and follow ups, blocking cards and promting to call the WRONG phone number -and when you're closed, and to add that you don't answer calls.

Wow have they been down 3 months? Im still waiting for a call back from September!
"You're not here to help 50,000 of your own pensioners that you impose pension clawback on! Some of the lowest paid, mainly women, losing over 30% of their hard-worked for pensions, whilst the highest paid and fatcats suffer hardly anything! Not fair and it was not properly explained to the majority of those staff. Imagine retiring on a pension of less than \xa310,000 a year and then having a third of that taken back simply because you start receiving the meagre State Pension. HSBC your share price might be suffering and you might have issues around the China/USA trade war, plus you might still have issues surrounding money laundering and such like BUT you can still afford to remove the unfairness and inequity of clawback.

You have just lost me as a customer.

It would be great if you could answer your customer service line. I\u2019ve been cut off many times in the last few days after I\u2019ve been waiting 30 minutes plus. Not a great way to treat your customers. I\u2019ve sent a direct message now. Let\u2019s hope someone reads it and get backs to me. Awful service by HSBC!

Maybe this is why phones should be based in each country you operate in . So there's always someone from that country to answer calls.  Relying on a call centre in a far away place isn't always the best idea

Your online app instructions don't match your online banking instructions. Your online banking is way too complicated.

On 15th December I sent an email to customer care team I understood that I would have a reply within 5 working days. I am still waiting. Not very impressed with your service. I have tried to get an answer to my question in branch but was told there was nobody there that could give me an answer. Spoke to someone on the phone and they also could not give me a proper answer so I tried the same question in an email and still no answer. So I am trying this route.
Well done Neil.

I\u2019ve spent over 8 hours on hold today. After 2 hours and 18 mins someone picked up then cancelled the call. I called again and I\u2019m sat here approaching 6 hours. \nIn what way do you think this is acceptable? I have a letter stating that I need to call you urgently. Yet for the past 10 days I\u2019ve spent over 40 hours on hold and I haven\u2019t spoken to a single person from the team I\u2019m trying to contact. \nJUST ANSWER THE PHONE\n

"I don\u2019t bloody think so! Thankfully HSBC have good safety measures in place, thank you \n\nYour one-time passcode is @@@@@ for a payment of GBP 1,024.81 to Loveholidays on card ending @@@@. It's valid for 10 mins for this payment only - ref @@@@"
This Racist History Month HSBC is doing what it always does and virtue signalling while doing absolutely nothing to help customers during coronavirus 
"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.\nWithin 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - \xa34000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!\nHSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.\nOntop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.\nHSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.\nI HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
Thank you HSBC i dont get to eat tonight because you sent me a fraud alert when i was trying to order off deliveroo and said i should wait for a follow up text with instructions which never came! Went to online chat and your rep whos grammer was terrible could not even help as your fraud team are off for the night!
"HSBC where\u2019s the OTP text, it\u2019s been an hour and I\u2019m waiting to purchase an item, joke of a bank\U0001f92c"
SORT IT OUT FFS WHY HAVE U PUT MY ACC UNDER REVIEW !??!?
"Sadly, I used to work for HSBC but the service is absolutely shocking. Probably the worst experience i have ever had with any Company. 6 months and no sign of my dispute being resolve, Everyone has learned to cope with the pandemic but no HSBC - disgusted"
"Hi ,  HSBC award winning service again .. waited 90 mins on the morgage help line to have someone pick the phone up and then put it down!!   Excelleclnt service again !!  Keep up the bad work !!"
Also please can you answer as to thy you are reported as one of the worst for customer service??????
"Raised a dispute they sent me an email i was unable to sign, went to.my bank they couldnt help. Dispute date ended. Requested a call back for at least a month, no call back.\nI shall be leaving this bank. \nNo amount of COVID has caused this ridiculous service.\n"
I have now spent over 92 hours in 8 working days on two phones trying to reach you guys about an APP Fraud. Looks like I won\u2019t be getting my money back before Christmas to buy the presents I was defrauded from. Guys sort it out please

Worst bank out there
Where was children in need when all the starving school kids needed feeding counting there pounds at home corrupt charity 
My husband applied for a bounce back loan nearly TWO MONTHS ago & has still heard nothing other than the automated acknowledgment. The recording on the helpline says you aren't taking calls at all! Even making allowances for the current situation this is pretty shocking service!
I would love to donate again this year to Children in Need. Unfortunately though HSBC has frozen my business account. They sent me a letter to say they would close the account last month and send me a cheque for the balance. Unfortunately for myself and my staff they have not kept to their word. I know this is a pointless post but just wanted to say they are certainly not all sweetness and light as they are trying to make out
Just had a scam text and I\u2019m not even a customer lol 
"its getting harder to know who you are talking to at hsbc not able get through on phones, call backs are from overseas but say they are in uk ,scam ? dont know , sort yourselves out please. still on phone when i could be working."
"In that case HSBC need to give customers some time \u23f0 who don\u2019t doing business, many HSBC Account may get freeze \U0001f976 due to no transactions for more than six months in this 2020 due to COVID-19. "
Absolutely appalling service. Trying to activate my new security device for my business account. Can't get to speak to anybody and keep getting logged off the chat service. Rubbish.
"In that case HSBC need to give customers some time \u23f0 who don\u2019t doing business, many HSBC Account may get freeze \U0001f976 due to no transactions for more than six months in this 2020 due to COVID-19. I got a \U0001f4e7  regarding no transactions for last 3 months. They want to know whether I am alive or dead. "
"I know Covid has affected staff numbers and been used as an excuse to close more branches, or cut opening hours but it does seem HSBC are deliberately cutting UK service to personal and small business customers. Just like they mistreat their own staff pensioners, doing the minimum they can legally get away with."
\U0001f92c
"HSBC HAS LITERALLY STOLEN MY MONEY. I opened an account, deposited tens of thousands and almost immediately after the account has been recommended for closure for no reason for over a month in which time my funds have been held and they refuse to release them to me. This cannot be legal. It is outrageous and I will be taking legal action. DO NOT USE THIS BANK"
"Steve, sent you a private message about this. Take a look?"
Thank you Sir! \U0001f44d
Halifax have been brilliant since I switched from HSBC
"Been holding thirteen minutes now, does anyone know if there is a problem with their call centre? "
"Stop blaming COVID for lack of service. We have been trying to get through to someone for two days all you get is a bot or the line goes dead. We are wanting to speak to someone about an international transfer to another bank which did not go through a month ago, which we have only learnt about this week.  We never received notification as to why this has not happend and its vital this transaction takes place. WTH HSBC!!!!"
I have tried to privately message you but it won\u2019t go through. I have written to hsbc on Instagram but they directed me to you. I made a payment to my neighbour over some marketing work she helped me with as I have been building a website as I haven\u2019t worked since March due to Covid. I add the payment and by mistake - it went to an old account Madderson that she was involved in but the account Should have bounced back as it was closed. I spoke to my bank immediately at Barclays and they sent a message giving you my neighbours personal details to put the money in. The problem is nothing has happened and now this is causing w problem with mh neighbour as she still needs to be paid and I haven\u2019t earned money since March so this is causing a lot of stress. Please can someone email me on kate@fitnesscamp.co.uk and look into this ASAP so we can resolve it please ! Thanks kate 
"Hi I would like to know how to esculate a complaint please.\nI filed a complaint form, I've recieved multiple emails stating that my complaint has been resolved but I haven't actually recieved a response to the complaint at all.\nYou can't just resolve a problem by saying its resolved and not actually speaking to your customers"
"You've got a local branch, Sandra?! "
I hope Elaine Arden has a thought about the people at RBS that suffered abuse when she was head of HR and have had to deal with it on their own. Cheers Elaine
"This makes no difference, I\u2019ve been on hold for 26 hours and counting. You send me letters that tell me to \u201ccall urgently\u201d and don\u2019t pick up. "
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n\nHSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n\nTIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!"
Can you please explain WHY I have just got another email asking for a bank statement ?? I called the number you gave me 3 days ago cancelling my application !!!! I also asked for confirmation that it had been done. No confirmation just another stupid email ? PLEASE CONFIRM MY APPLICATION HAS BEEN CANCELLED ASAP  Sending as no reply to my message.
"Just being able to log into the app would be nice. For some reason you need to send me two activation codes. One by email and one by mobile. The email one came through but after 3 times of asking, still no text. "
"Just under three hours on hold trying to get through regarding BBLS (5 months and counting) and then I got disconnected once someone answered. Shocking. How anyone has stayed with HSBC as a customer is beyond me. I have emailed you using the response email someone posted below, hoping someone will do the decent thing and respond to me..."
Alternatively you can protect your wallet and sanity by dumping the Worst Bank Ever HSBC and switching 
"Thanks for leaving me confused. Received a letter apparently from yourselves last week, regarding an account I had over 10 years ago and compensation for that account. Rang you directly and was told to disregard the letter as no record of any correspondence from you. Yet a representative from your apparent official HSBC Twitter account tells me it is legitimate and gives me a number to ring to speak to the dedicated team, the same number on the letter, which when I Google it comes up as a number ringing people claiming to be HSBC and scamming people. If something looks too good to be true it likely is but you need to be singing from the same hymn sheet. Why have I got one of your employees advising me to ring a scam number? Won't be doing. Glad I no longer bank with you."
"So far we have totalled 6 and half hours on hold trying to get business banking help. Spoken to two \u2018advisers\u2019 when we do get lucky enough to speak to someone. Turns out to be a total waste of time as they all have the same script. Basically they can\u2019t help/advise/tell you anything. Husband has banked with this bank for over 30 years. Big mistake taking up business banking with HSBC and we regret doing so. If a company tell you they have \u2018escalated your problem to the highest priority \u2018 after 5 weeks and a visit to try and speak to a real person at a branch , wouldn\u2019t you think it would be dealt with or at least had some contact within a week later ?? Awful service"
1 Hour on hold and waiting continuously - let me guess - 'COVID-19' the excuse? - ROUTINE
Waiting for our redemption statement for over a week now. Us and our solicitors have spent hours on the phone every day. We are due to move tomorrow and this will now fall through! Disgusting service!
"I need to activate my Google pay! You've blocked it... But to activate it, I have to confirm my identity.... An hour wait to confirm my identity for an app YOU stopped!"
Is anyone going to bother to reply to me!! You have refunded the WRONG credit card after waiting over 14 weeks! Will someone please refund the correct credit card and get back to me with how long it will take until the money will be back into my account. You are the WORST bank going and have done nothing to help me. I am not wasting anymore hours trying to call you when you never call me back as promised! Ridiculous! I expect a response TODAY!
"Well done, now please do something productive like sorting out our bounce back loans... "
WOW I'm so glad they can employ somebody to turn some lights on......... How about answering your phones? Or keeping you Online Chat actually online? Or answering e-mails? 45 minutes plus ever time you phone before anybody thinks about answering your call. And they take money out of your account before checking you still require the service that are charging you for. BUT it's all Covid's fault!!!! Muppets using lame excuses...
Terrible service at the moment. I am into nearly 2 months just trying to get a new security device. Any tax late payment bills will be coming your way!
"Need to really improve your call wait times! Hour and 15 mins waiting to speak to someone, how is that acceptable customer service?!"

"I am disgusted in the level of customer service from HSBC. I am a Director for a CIC who house homeless veterans and provide them with rehabilitation and mental health services. I have now been locked out of my business account almost three months. This has had a crippling effect on my service users and my company. I have provided all documents, spent hours on hold and been into branch. I will not be advocating HSBC as a business banking facility to anyone in the near future."

"I have been trying to contact HSBC for two days. I cannot activate my replacement secure key for online banking, I go in store and they tell me to contact by phone. I've been on the phone twice each time on hold for 2 hours. Also, live chat is not working online. I am effectively frozen out of my business account and cannot access.

"Hi there, I would like to know if HSBC has paid out ANY top ups for bounce back loans. My original bounce back loan application was a positive experience, applied on a Friday and money available the following Tuesday. But NOW, my application for a top up was made on the 23rd of November, and all I've had is a none committal answers from telephone calls.  Backlog is the answer, and whilst I can see the obvious inundation of applications for the start of the Loan scheme, the cut off point was the 30th of September for new applications (if memory serves) and at that point it was stated that HSBC had a backlog of 3000 loan applications (yahoo finance, 14th December). So obviously, the question does NOT ask for specific bank details, just an answer as to IF HSBC has paid out ANY top up Loans to companies, who have already received a bounce back loan payment. "
Can you please reply to my message?
HSBC are threatening to close bank accounts if you do not wear a mask. This will soon change to if you havent been vaccinated be under no doubt. If you have an account with HSBC I would suggest you cancel it now. This kind of totalitarian behaviour is not acceptable.

"Very disappointed with the abysmal customer service at the HSBC in Harrow, London, this afternoon. Two apparent customer service 'assistants' barked at me to queue TWICE from outside the bank because I needed to use two machines inside the bank, to withdraw and deposit money from my accounts! In addition, two of the three deposit machines inside the bank did not work! I refused to queue twice or give any credence to two rude, jumped up, good for nothing customer service agents and as a result HSBC missed out on my deposit and most likely my future business! Perhaps HSBC should divert resources into maintaining their 'self service' machines instead of employing unhelpful assistants that are obsessed with marshalling queues, lost on a deluded mini power trip and have an unnerving propensity to shout at their customers!#SHOCKING-SUB-STANDARD-CUSTOMER-SERVICE!"

Hsbc your telephone and internet service is beyond a joke! Your can\u2019t keep blaming Covid-19 your are the only company I have had such horrendous problems with and your wait time is awful 
I aplaude and welcome the idea... well done

Disabilities as well now is it? marketing dept must be ticking all the boxes....
I opened my first bank account in the late 80\u2019s (midland bank) I\u2019ve been a customer of HSBC from the (UK) beginning. Why won\u2019t you answer my calls? You have spent time and money sending me letters that specifically ask to \u201ccall us urgently\u201d yet you don\u2019t answer! I\u2019m closing in on 28 hours on hold and I can\u2019t deal with the awful music anymore. 
11th call to HSBC regarding the BBL after applying in October to still have no idea what is happening everytime I call i get the same answer that ill either hear within 24 hours or within 5-10 days. This had apparently been escalated however still nothing. After waiting for over an hour most times and the last two having the phone hung up on me before even speaking to someone is shambolic! Has anyone else had issues and if so who did you contact to complain. Will the FSA take this? 
I LOVE HOW I GET TOLD THAT I WILL GET CALL BACKS FROM COMPLAINTS/DISPUTES TEAMS AND NEVER DO!!
I\u2019ve sent you messages after you asked me to but guess what - no reply!!\nIf I can\u2019t pay my bills due to Covid will you be as patient as you expect everyone else to be??!!
"Same as all the banks.  Try to project a touchy feely image, but ready to screw you at the first opportunity.  Me?  A cynic?  Surely not."

"Financial Fitness Plan. Don't make me laugh. You're the bank that allows thousands of its own staff pensioners to be stitched up. Not having told most of them about clawback, you now take up to 30% of pension back from the lowest paid, whilst only taking 2% or less from the highest paid. Many of your own long serving clerical staff left in poverty due to your own immorality. Senior management and directors protecting their own. Time to do the right thing and cancel clawback. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"

"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"

You haven't helped at all. Reducing the hours of branches but then not changing the rules of what you have to go into branches for. Making life significantly harder not easier.
"Our treasurer left our bowls club at the beginning of August. Since then we have been trying to have our new treasurer made a signatory and to have access to our account online. Well so far after months the new treasurer can sign cheques but otherwise they continue to let our old treasurer have online access to our account and continue to send post to his address. Everything takes an age and of course there is nobody to speak too. After our first complaint they sent us \xa350 and basically told us to get lost. They are rubbish, do yourself a favour and bank somewhere else."
"Bit like HSBC - ooh you've got a gold plated staff pension so we'll pay you less or give you less bonus - then we'll take 30% of that pension back as well and leave you with little.

I need to make a formal complaint about  about my payments for my holiday. I want to complete a charge back quickly. My husband lost his job and we have struggled to complete the payments but now they will not give us our money back as we cannot travel. It has caused a lot of stress and affected our mental health as I am worried that I will not be able to go back to working as a teacher in time for the new term. I need to speak to someone as it is causing a lot of worry and stress.

Financial fitness plan don't make me laugh....  you have lost a customer who has been banking with you for over 25 years because of your lack of customer service and unable to change my bank and credit card...  I never realised how easy it was to move everything to somebody else !
Amazing! \U0001f44d xx
I\u2019ve been offered a business overdraft which I do not want. Have been on hold for over an hour and slowly giving up hope of speaking to anyone. There\u2019s no way of knowing whether I\u2019m next in the queue or have 100\u2019s of people in front of me. All I want to do is reject the overdraft as I know HSBC will charge me for this!!! Really bad show
"Tried all yesterday to speak to your Business Banking agents, kept on phone, absolutely ridiculous, why can you not open up like Santander on Saturdays, HSBC Bishops Stortford closed.  No phone service for business customers when they most need it.  Now considering taking all my accounts away both personal and business."
im sure the rest of us will agree we would rather have the money put into you providing a better service than decorating you offices with fancy lighting
"Hello, my account has been blocked since Thursday.\nI have been constantly trying to get in touch with the team to get this resolved as I currently have no access to any other funds and you are leaving me in a very vulnerable position.\nYesterday I was hold for 6 hours, and today I have been on hold for a few hours.  I have just spoken to somebody who said she was connecting me to a manager at which point the call cut off once again.\nIt is not acceptable to block my account without any explanation nor being able to speak to somebody about this.\nPlease can your team call me back urgently to resolve this matter."
42 days since applying for a business account with zero progression ... madness HSBC ! What is going on ?? Told now the wait time is not known ... terrible 
So proud of you both! \U0001f4aa\U0001f3fc
Stop clawing back people's pensions.  No one was told about this at all.  I was 16 when I started work at the bank and had no idea about pensions and none of it was ever explained or anything in writing.  It is a disgrace.
I have sent twice the council tax bill and still no answer. I have 2 months since I am waiting for my account to be opened. I think I will give up after reading the comments.
"Awful customer service holding on the phone for ever , get your act together!!!!!"
"This may be helpful to some, but those of us who will soon be victims of Clawback are already getting in to the habit of looking for loose change behind the sofa, in the wardrobe and anywhere else in anticipation of you reducing our pensions. How you can seriously believe it is fair to penalise those on the lowest income is beyond me. "

So we are being taught to budget by HSBC. How ironic. Their employees budget carefully for retirement only to find that at state pension age HSBC claw money back from their pensioners who then have to budget again because they have less money. HSBC think that it is acceptable because it was \u2018clearly communicated\u2019 when we all joined the bank many years ago. Funny that they won\u2019t provide definitive proof of this as these pensioners only found about this \u2018state deduction\u2019 as HSBC call it as it started affecting some many years later and after many years of loyal service. Look to your business morals HSBC as other companies did many years ago and reverse this state deduction. #fightingforfairness

Hi - We really could do with your assistance please? We applied for a government backed BBL with you around 3 weeks ago as our bank has stopped doing them (Tide). We've completed all tasks required in the process but it would appear the HSBC Identify app on IOS is not uploading the documents as it's stating it has. we've called your BBLS hotline and after being on hold for around 1hr 5 mins the line goes dead. We've tried this process several times and it would appear the process has broken. Could we go in to our local branch to speed this process up or can you call me please?

"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.\nWithin 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - \xa34000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!\nHSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.\nOntop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.\nHSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.\nI HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
How to alienate your customers. Update your banking app that is not compatible with my devise. So I log in via the web page and doesn't like my log in details. Reset and call HSBC to confirm reset. Log back on and it locks me out. Now huge vol of calls. Bloody useless

Hi HSBC when you apply online for a mortgage holiday extension do you receive some sort of email confirming receipt of your application? I\u2019m only asking as I\u2019ve received nothing and wanted to make sure that my application has been received.
Scam is having your account blocked depsite giving you a travel notification then holding for the fraud department for 27 mins and getting cut off. I am in Australia and can't hold for that long for nothing as it is costing a fortune to call overseas. Not good enough as you have now left me with no access to my money. How am I supposed to live without money
Could you remove spurious trackers and third party cookies while you're at it please. There is no place for this sort of thing in online banking.
I would Never Ever Bank with HSBC ! Their Staff do not know their Geography ! Their Ad on tv says Britain is not an Island ! How Ignorant is that !!! Britain is an Island and always will be and thank god for it ! 
"HSBC Fraud Team are appalling. I was a victim of an APP fraud, and contacted by the Fraud team as they required more information. I have been on hold for 8 hours over the last 3 days, been cut off by Customer Support. In addition the Fraud team messed up my replacement debit card; so I still can't access my account and am using friends/family to buy me food. \n\nHow can I progress my case and claim my money back? This afternoon I had ANOTHER scam call using my account details, mothers maiden name, new address, recent banking transaction. This was information I never shared with the criminals - they had it all - and due to my recent house move I know it is a recent hack of HSBC - there is no other possibility! Therefore criminals are still actively using my details to hack my account.\n\nThe only choice I can see due to HSBC appalling customer support is to contact the Financial Ombudsman to start a case to claim back the money, telephone calls cost, money borrowed from friends/family and affect on them, compensation for the stress etc."
I phoned NatWest and they answered straight away. UK based call centres too. Great service!
When will you answer the calls . You\u2019ve left a old man with no food after stopping his cards as he apparently was in the wrong account !! Shame on you. I\u2019m taking to the local press 
"Reading these comments doesn\u2019t make me feel quite so bad that I only waited 30 minutes on hold before getting cut off. HSBC, I\u2019m sure you are experiencing high call volumes but why send out an email asking someone to call when you have their mobile phone number on record and it would be easier for you to call them? My mortgage payment got reversed last month due to insufficient funds and I\u2019d spoken to an HSBC adviser, shortly afterwards, who arranged with me to take the payment on the 3rd of this month, 7 days before the next mortgage direct debit goes out. Guess what, it never happened so I suppose it\u2019s my fault and that\u2019s why they want me to get in touch with them. HSBC, if you actually get to read this, you can call or email me but I\u2019m not listening to a message that sounds like a war time speech and then echo chamber music for another 30 minutes to get cut off again. I tried for 20 minutes this morning and 30 minutes just now but that\u2019s it! Find a good alternative way of contacting me about this issue and I\u2019ll be more than happy to discuss it with a real person. Have a nice day \U0001f642"

"APPALLING BANK, HUNG UP AFTER 45 MINUTES THE OTHER WEEK AND NOW BEEN WAITING 11 MINUTES AND THIS IS A SO CALLED BUSINESS ACCOUNT, SERVICE LIKE THIS WILL MAKE ANY COMPANY LOOK ELSEWHERE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. \n\nThis has now left me with no other option than to contact:\n1: The financial ombudsman \n2. BBC Watchdog\n3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.\n\nIt's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! \n\nIf you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. \n\nAbsolutely appalling service.\n"

"My parents, who are in their 80's are having difficulty claiming a holiday refund. They have a supporting letter from ABTA stating HSBC are responsible for the refund and reasons why. Been told to go into their branch, which they did (Covid risk & Mum's just had surgery) then to 'go on-line',.....they're not on-line.Bank won't speak to another family member, must be them. Been left hanging on the telephone which cut them off after an hour. My brother is trying to deal with it on their behalf (remotely as we're all keeping our distance at the moment) he is hitting the same brick walls.....but hoping he gets there in the end."
"Does anyone have a recommendation to switch away from HSBC? They seem to have turned into a massive rip off charging extortionate interest rates on personal loans, even to someone who has banked with them loyally for 30+ years. Like a payday lender or loan bucket shop. Current interest rates are a half of one percent but HSBC thinks it\u2019s acceptable to add over \xa33k interest on a \xa35.8k borrowing amount. "
"I am not having a good experience setting up my new HSBC account and registering on-line.  I want to register so I can start to invest money in my new current account and also one or more savings accounts and I have no telephone security number which I must have to proceed.  Visited a branch and was told it would be posted to me, and nothing has arrived, phoned the number advertised on your website several times, which is not a good experience and expensive, and twice spoke to an agent who said it had been posted, and still nothing has arrived.  I am starting to think I have made a mistake in starting the switching process and I must say your customer service could and should be improved."
"I'm absolutely disgusted with HSBC's customer service. I spent nearly an hour yesterday on the phone trying to make an appointment with the branch for my son to open a student account. We are both existing customers. I have been with HSBC for over 30 years. We were told that there are no branch appointments at the moment due to Covid, but we simply had to take I'd, proof of student status into the branch and we would be able to open one from there. We went into the branch today to be turned away and told to open the account online and that they could not help us in the branch...very unhelpful and certainly not what I've come to expect from HSBC... we will be taking our business elsewhere in the future."
"So, let's talk about fraud.\nYou as a government approved BBLs lender are not directly declining small businesses for a bounce back loan because that's not permitted within governed guidelines and your not allowed to perform credit rating checks during that application.\nWhat you are doing is asking applicants to apply for a ""Feeder account"" first and then declining on grounds of credit score therefore denying access to the bounce back loan.\nhttps://www.facebook.com/1613996413/posts/10221249037488182/?sfnsn=scwspmo&extid=9gAadbb6tzINhqMz"

Why r u blocking me from sending a instant payment to another bank account of mine until tomorrow saying transactions after 6pm r processed next day what a joke and before u say its standard with all accounts I was able to receive money from someone else after 6pm instantly into my account just u blocking my payments. What a bloody joke

I am a HSBC pensioner I had 33 years service .
Have been trying to get hold of Business banking on and off over the last 4 weeks and have had to hang up due to the calls not being answered. On average we have held on for over an hour each time. We have even tried using the secure online messaging service too but again no response. This is utterly appalling service... how on earth are you supposed to run a business... all we want to do is order a new banking fob as the batteries are about to run out on the one we have and we won't be able to access our money.

Oh yes Lucy-Anne that is HSBC on it's best for you. I have never ever in my life seen bad service like they do it.
"""Imaginations Run Wild?"" my backside- try getting your basic banking services right first. I've been trying to get money transferred from my Credit Card Account back into my Current Account (Which was a refund from British Airways) since 4th January. I was initially told, by someone called Christian, it would take 4 days. Still no sign so on using the web chat service today I've now been told, today Tuesday 12 January by someone called Askshith, that it will take up to 6 working days (FROM TODAY) ie 20th January. Over 2 hours it took me to get that information today from him/her. I keep getting the run around from people overseas who apologise in a patronising way telling me that they ""understand"". All they ever do is apologise - and nothing ever gets done. They also try to blame some ""team"" somewhere. It's never they're fault.                                                                           What are you going to do about this to restore my confidence in your bank HSBC?"
Managing our budgets is an interesting concept from HSBC. My wife and I have 60 years employment with them combined and were never advised of clawback ... or 'state deduction' as they did refer to it so we all thought it was the government deducting not them. Yet they claim clear and consistent communication yet can provide no proof. Even their trust company and later pfs advisors never mentioned it. Budgeting advise Ha Ha. My wife and I lose a considerable part of our pensions at 66/67.
Absolutely awful bank. You blocked my card for no reason and my shopping would not have been delivered unless I had a credit card to pay Tesco over the phone. I am isolating so I am truly stuck. Your customer service don't know who blocked my card and I have to wait 5 working days to get a new one. You call yourselves a caring bank. When I was stuck at home and needed you most you shafted me!
This bank dont care. \n\nThey have royally messed up my banking because they had a change. \nDidnt notify mean the change was coming. \nFor months I've tried to fix my situation but HSBC system or uselessness wont allow a fix. \n\nI'm a single dad having to shop with cash. They took my card. Changed my banking. \nI have to take my daughter into the banks. Into the shops and risk both our health in this pandemic and I have an underlying health issue i should not be out all the time. \n\nThere is much more to this and they know it but still I have no bank card. I cant shop on line  I have no choice but handle cash and deal with ppl in person. \n\nThanks HSBC your actually making it hard for me to nit catch covid. \nAs shopping and banking is the only contact we have if I get we get covid it will be the banks doing. \U0001f92c\U0001f92c\U0001f92c

"HSBC's treatment of their business customers is abolutley shocking, I have been with the bank for 6 and half years running a small but profitable limited company, all of a sudden my accounts are all frozen, after spending a full day on hold nobody would tell me why, 5 days later I receive a letter saying the account is going to be shut down, no explanation as to why and I can't even get in touch with anyone to find out what is going on. This treatment is absolutley disgusting, they have crippled my business for no good reason. I run a small online company and can think of no reason why my account should be closed down. I would advise anyone thinking of opening an account with HSBC to think twice before they do, a simple search online will highlight the fact that I am not the only one who has had their business account closed without warning, HSBC have closed down hundreds of business accounts in the UK without warning or explanation, sort it out HSBC "
HSBC - my husband (who doesn\u2019t have Facebook) is at his wits end trying to get in touch. Been ringing for days and still waiting an hour later. He has just changed banks to yourself and the switching process is due to complete 6th November but no telephone banking number so can\u2019t register online. Everything apart from that has arrived in the post. I have sent a PM but no response. Please can someone help 
HSBC Is the scam . Disgusting 
I wish you was the bank who replied to emails.

"Okay HSBC might not be the best bank in the country but they are a worldwide bank and when I lived in Canada for 5 years they helped me setup an account over there, so before you lot blast this post, just take a step back and think about the people who work out there in Manila and what it must be like for them right now, even with this Covid pandemic that has put us all into lockdown, these people and the call centres are doing their best in a bad situation, no matter if it\u2019s a bank, your broadband provider, whoever they are working as best as they can, I used to work for a call centre and the amount of abuse that I\u2019ve seen staff take it can have a negative effect on their mental health so give that some consideration please. \U0001f44a\U0001f60a\U0001f44a"

"HSBC Bloody useless bank!  Been waiting nearly 12 weeks for bounce back loan,  chased sign-off docs, signed them three weeks ago, was told money would be in account within 48 hours, still nothing! AND that is after chasing it up upteen times, Bank Manager been on the case for last week, he's getting no-where, apparently.  Anyone thinking of joining this bank should think twice, as I know lots of people leaving it!  I have been with the bank for 35 years, when it was Midland Bank, since becoming HSBC, it has slowly gone down hill to an incompetent mess!"
Well done both of you.  \U0001f600
You are seriously the worst bank when it comes to customer service!! Can someone contact me ASAP?
It\u2019s will be better for HSBC not to look \U0001f440 at new customers rather then searching for old customers who got account \U0001f4b0 with HSBC and provide them proper service. Due to COVID-19 people are not able to send money to some body\\company online. 
Can I ask you are so against fraud but getting in touch with you is pathetic.  Yep we heard Covid is the excuse.  What for such pathetic service.\n\nI needed help.  Contacted Facebook who gave number.  Because I don't have a pin to talk it went no further.   Could deal with it if you had branches open on a Saturday.  You are just a bank who doesn't  care!!!!!!
"I\u2019m disheartened by the level of service and execution delivered by HSBC customer services. I\u2019ve been pursuing a transaction dispute since April of this and have finally withdrawn 9 years of custom after over 10 hours on the phone and no resolution. \n\nI\u2019ve been promised a call back from the Disputes department, Customer Services, various managers and to no avail. On Friday 11th December, I was threatened by a member of staff that if I escalated this case, she wouldn\u2019t extend anymore goodwill and assist me - she didn\u2019t assist me anyway. \n\nI understand that we are in the midst of a pandemic but the way that your Disputes Department has managed this is deplorable. \n\nMy father had a stroke and this money is now needed for urgent matters. \n\nI\u2019m extremely saddened that HSBC\u2019s fecklessness and disregard for their customers.

Congratulations on getting 2 million people on bikes. Wish you were as efficient getting bounce back loans to businesses that need them! Application received 22 June and still waiting!!!! Many hours and stress waiting on 2 hour telephone queues. Absolutely aweful service from a bank i have been with personally and as a business for 30+ years. Disgusting!
"Be very careful with this bank. HSBC is holding my money hostage. I have not been able to access my money from my account since beginning of December 2020. Like if we don\u2019t have enough problems already. I have since been informed by the bank that it was blocked and I will not be able to access any of my money because they have begun closing the account. The reason being they supposedly sent one letter requiring a \u201cproof of address\u201d which I never received. Despite being with the bank for many years and my statements arrive at my address every month. No call, no warning in the app, nothing!! However, closing the account is taking them weeks. I put a complaint in just after Christmas that they close it immediately so I can receive my money. Why the delay if you have started closing it. I received this only today:\n""I can confirm that we are unable to remove the restrictions which have been placed on inline with our policy because we have been unable to complete safeguard. We have received your closure request and our team will process the request in due course. Unfortunately, we are unable to advise of times at present""\nOn their own website it says it should not take more than 10 days : https://www.business.hsbc.uk/en-gb/business-account-closure\nIn order words, I should put my whole life on hold until they feel like giving me my own money. Don\u2019t worry about the bills and taxes that I need to pay.\nThis can happen to you too. You were warned!! I have never written a bad review, but feel in this case, I should warn others.\n\nPerhaps this bank is only interested in customers that they can put into dept, very much like a payday lender as opposed to a real bank. \nWhat is the reason for holding my money hostage HSBC? I have been in contact with another bank and honestly, the difference is night and day. If you are not someone in dept, it would appear that is not the \u2018bank\u2019 for you. To add further insult, I received a letter yesterday stating I will be charged for the period I had no access to my account. What strange behaviour."
When is what HSBC termed state deduction (which staff presumed was the reduced pension we also suffer because we were contracted out for NI) not actually a state deduction?  It\u2019s when HSBC clawback 23% of my pension and unbelievably call it state deduction. I\u2019ve now got 2 deductions. The real state deduction which affects my state pension and the unexpected STATE DEDUCTION which is actually HSBC robbing my already meagre bank pension and NOTHING TO DO WITH THE STATE. The biggest mistake of my life was to think HSBC was a reputable  employer. It\u2019s a shameful company that does not practise what it preaches. 
Is it true that you will close a person's account for not wearing a mask?https://www.google.co.uk/amp/s/www.mirror.co.uk/money/barclays-santander--natwest-update-23314083.amp
\nI have a replacement security device and have received an access code. Please can you tell me where am  I supposed to enter this code?
Still waiting for my new debit card that your incompetent overzealous fraud department promised to send me. I don't want to hear any more pathetic excuses about you being concerned because I hung up the phone at the end of the phone call
No matter what colour creed or denomination you are all lives matter we are all human beings
"This is good. I remember Midland School Banks from about 30 years ago. You could also have educated your staff about the clawback feature of their pensions, or at least the pensions of 52,000 of your staff. Clawing back up to 30% of the pension when SPA is reached. That is for the lowest paid; the highest paid may have only 2% clawed back! This affects women far worse than men and the lowest paid far worse than the higher paid. Unfair and immoral. See www.midlandclawbackcampaign.co.uk"
Tried to call your business banking helpline 5x and held for hours - nobody ever answers. I am furious. I pay a fee for this service. Someone please contact me. 
How typhoon from Manila can affect power outage in London?? All other banks are doing normal banking.

I\u2019ll be leaving soon as I can. Really bad bank from the time I switched to them
Can someone please contact me? I have just waited 30 mins for the phone to be answered only for the rude guy then to cut me off!!!!!
Yet again no response from yourselves regarding business banking query\u2019s is anyone actually working today? No phone line no live chat no response to bank manager email. This is now holding up a business deal which is costing our business not only time but lost revenue! How can peoples businesses function without banking support? We have another account with Barclays and we have never encountered these issues! 
"Wow, looking at all of the dissatisfied customers in the below comments, I'm guessing that the original post didn't go the way they hoped. I for one wouldn't want to open an account with them."
What a joke when your app has been out of order 6 weeks and counting
"What if HSBC are the fraudsters, posing as a caring bank but in reality they are beyond SHOCKING with their 'customer service' and are completely inaccessible? Its ok....their too big to be bothered by human/customer experience."
On hold for over an hour to sort a mandate that the branch has lost TWICE! This has been ongoing for 11 months - shocking service.  
"It's hard to claw your way back to 'Normality' because banks like HSBC don't help you to do it.\nWithin 120 day period for chargeback after being scammed, and HSBC never respond to the dispute claim - \xa34000 I am owed, and they are legally obliged to assist - and won't - so i am in financial distress due to their incompetence/apathy/lack of training - because they are ALL OUTSOURCED!\nHSBC tries to save money by outsourcing EVERYTHING - regardless if their customer service goes down the drain.\nOntop that - HSBC decline a payment holiday extension after me losing my job - on the basis that I made two payments towards my personal loan when the first holiday finished.\nHSBCs mentality is that - I am a worse candidate for a payment holiday by consciously trying to pay my loan against someone else who had a continuous payment holiday and extension.\nI HOPE YOU SERIOUSLY GET SHUT DOWN!"
Maybe this is a problem when customer services are overseas!!! We are relying on other country\u2019s climates etc which then means we can\u2019t contact our banks or shops customer services. Hope all in Manila are ok though
Get your security team to get this taken down then \U0001f621 http://hsbc.blocked-payee.com/secure/

PLEASE STOP YOUR PHONE BANKING SERVICE - ITS USELESS- alSO CREDIT CARD SECURITY SYSTEM IS JUST NOT WORKING- IT CREATE MORE ISSUE- 
"I'm still in shock that i cannot see my online credit card transactions, I have to download as a CSV month by month!\nPlease fix this or i'll leave..."
I have an investment portfolio with you. As of today my apple share holding does not reflect the stock split that occurred on Monday. Please advise ASAP as I am unable to sell currently.
I have moved home from living abroad and need to access my recent transactions and then close my hsbc uk bank account eventually. I am locked out of my hsbc app due to not having a security key and not having the same phone number or address in which originally opened my bank account and therefore cannot access my account!!! Everytime I try to call the number on your website or message you facebook it says your centre is closed!!!!!!
They are supporting Poppy week/BLM/children in Need to make themselves look credible.Look into their human rights record.....
"Maybe you need improve the \u2018capabilities\u2019 of your website and app! All I want to do is change my address. Your website wants a security code, fine, but when I type it in, it\u2019s not recognised, USELESS!! \U0001f621"
"Hello, can you confirm if the application process for an 11 year olds bank account can be done online due to the pandemic? I was told this by NatWest and made to send documents via special delivery but then told I also had to come in branch and I don\u2019t really want to be spending another \xa36 on sending documents only to be told I need to visit a branch again "
What like yourselves. Lose my money and still waiting for my refund!!!!!
"I have been subject to fraud by a festival organiser who refused to issue a refund and I wanted to claim a chargeback as there is no other way for me to receive back the money !! However I have purchased the tickets end of December last year, please tell me that you still can help me"
30 mins wait to be cut off. Terrible service. Phoned different bank who answered in 10 and are more than happy to take my business 
"Dear HSBC nimweats , I do have a question, apart from the fact that you can\u2019t apologise properly, you don\u2019t have a good service either. What is the point of you sending me a check which I can\u2019t cash up because you basically oblige me to open a bank account? That means your apologies is as crap as your services. Useless! You are not able to repair your mistakes! "
"\u26a0\ufe0f They\u2019re sending cheques for \xa325 now pretending to be HSBC. I received one yesterday, I put it in my profile this morning asking people to share to make others aware.  \U0001f61e "
Thought I did budget for my retirement until I found out HSBC will clawbank some of my staff pension. Shame on you HSBC we were told how  great our pensions were and it was all part of our package/salaries. 
I hope that my colleagues in Manila are safe. 
I literally just got a text message from someone claiming to be you guys.
That\u2019s a great\U0001f44d partnership HSBC has chosen. Hope other UK banks can learn \U0001f4d6something different from This.
I got a 'Safeguard ' scam letter through the post wanting my info. Looks very genuine. 
Have been on hold to HSBC since 10.00 am this morning.  Call cuts out after 4 hours of waiting so this is the third attempt today. Is anybody there ?
"Is this why I\u2019m now at 1 hour and 4 mins waiting to speak to someone in business banking this is absolutely disgusting, the charges I pay for a business account and this is the service you get"
Applied for Bounce Back Loan over 2 months ago and still waiting to get even a reply!! Any attempt to get information has been ignored. HSBC is definitely not the bank when it comes to small business support !! 
Glad I left in February
I help run a debt advice service & have noticed recently quite a number of people advising me that HSBC is adjusting default dates on old accounts deliberately to continue to show on people\u2019s credit reference reports far after the correct default date. ICO confirms to me that this a illegal activity. 
If you don\u2019t like what you are seeing then why follow at all. This is not the place to voice your point of view when you clearly have a grudge to bear.
"Applied for BBL with you guys in AUGUST!! Apart from an email confirming my application I've heard nothing! Hours and hours of waiting on the phones for you to answer. The BBL scheme was supposed to be there to help people with their businesses during difficult times. How are you helping exactly? My son did his with Natwest, ten days between application and receiving the money. HSBC are appalling!! "
Dear All\nHSBC talks about wanting REAL RELATIONSHIPS with their customers\nYet they resolve problems by EMAIL- KERRI MILLS head of customer service\nJUST PICK UP THE PHONE \u2013 like in the old days \u2013 when customer service meant something\n\nRegards\nRoger Wills
Love this from my colleagues.
Never open account in HSBC .this is worse bank in the world They blocked my account one year ago because someone transferred \xa390 and complaint that she did not received item.I provide them all the details and they are not responding every day i hold for 2 hours and than they tell me that higher investigation team is looking into this matter and they will come back. Every day i go to bank. their only response is higher team is looking this matter
"Good project by HSBC, hope other banks can also do that\u2019s same "
If anyone want free music..but don't have a radio..call HSBC you get two hours of free music while you wait for someone to answer. \U0001f937\U0001f3fb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f  wish I had never gone with this bank.
25 minutes on the phone to some GUY I can barely understand\nLocked out of online banking\nLocked out of telephone\nEVEN AFTER 25 minutes NO PROGRESS\nTHEN HE CUTS ME OFFTHE LINE\nYOU COULD NOT MAKE IT UP\nTake your money elsewhere and save the heartache\nHSBC you are a JOKE!!
"Dear Mr Quinn,\n\nPlease see below \u2013 now posted to facebook- in response to your very poor investigation of my complaint\n\nNobody likes to be called  liar ONCE but TWICE takes the biscuit by two different people Andrew Halliday - Executive Complaints Manager and Darren Witt - Supposedly Branch Manager Sudbury Suffolk\nApparently I have made my complaint up!\nI stand in the queue outside my local branch SUDBURY SUFFOLK for 10 minutes to pay money in\nThen go outside to change my pin\nThe machine had an out of order on the screen\nWhy if the machine was working would  I stand for another 10 minutes in the queue to go back into the branch to tell them it was not working\nIf it was working I would have changed my pin that I had just received in the post and been on my way????!!!!\n\nApparently both Mr Witt and Mr Halliday have lost the ability to use the telephone to phone up and apologise. Don't look the other way with BAD SERVICE. I won't accept this sort of BAD SERVICE on behalf of my elderly father"
"HSBC HAS LITERALLY STOLEN MY MONEY. I opened an account, deposited tens of thousands and almost immediately after the account has been recommended for closure for no reason for over a month in which time my funds have been held and they refuse to release them to me. This cannot be legal. It is outrageous and I will be taking legal action. DO NOT USE THIS BANK!!!"
"Many people can\u2019t do transactions on HSBC due to COVID-19, particularly outside UK. It\u2019s better not to close their accounts. "
"This company gave me the WRONG information Sunday 1st November. Consequently I have this week spent a total of 6 hours and 10 minutes in phone calls with Barclaycard over a 4 day perios who have also confirmed the information given by HSBC was inaccurate. Subsequently I have once again this afternoon phoned HSBC only to be CUT OFF for the second time after forty minutes. \n\nThis has now left me with no other option than to contact:\n1: The financial ombudsman \n2. BBC Watchdog\n3: A researcher I know personally who works for a well known TV show that exposes and brings to public attention situations like this.\n\nIt's absolutely astounding that all I wanted to do was make a simple balance transfer! \n\nIf you are going to employ cheap monkeys to operate a business, you can expect to turn into a zoo, which judging by the reviews here, you've succeeded. \n\nAbsolutely appalling service.\n"
"Two different phones - both on hold - One for business banking (3hrs+ consecutive calls), and the other on hold - personal banking.\n\nGot through to someone who I specifically told not to put me on hold and transfer me straight over - they advised they would do so and would come back to me in two minutes. This was twenty minutes ago!!\n\nHSBC STAFF ARE LIARS AND CON ARTISTS TO GET YOU OFF THE PHONE.\n\nTIME FOR THE FINANCIAL OMBUDSMEN!"
